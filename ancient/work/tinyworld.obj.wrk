To: Saad
From: Ahali(source)

  I have found the key to morgoths tower.  I might
have been seen as i left the tower, so i will be hiding
out in the southern part of town, in the poor sector for
two days.  I will return to the hideout in three days.
Ohhhh.... the treasures i saw.......

gone over the plans carefully now.  We sneak in through the
sewers.  There is a trapdoor down there that only Ahali knows
where is.  The trapdoor leads to one of his cellars.  Once again,
Ahali came through and got us a key for the cellar door.  From
there on we.....wait, i just heard someone scream.....
