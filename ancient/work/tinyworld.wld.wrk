Haven~
  Pillars of flawless white marble flow the height of this chamber laced with
a sparkling silver and golden outlines.  The ceiling, high above, combines
into a blackened dome, past which lie the stars and dreams of men.  The floor
that you trod upon seathes with etching as you can follow the lives of men
through etchings of things that were, are, and shall be.
  To the north a tremendous archway leads into a antechamber beyond from which
harmonous music flows.  Opposite, a pair of oaken doors span possible fifty
feet high towards the impending ceiling.  To the east a hall leads from the
base of Haven.

opens up to the plane of magic. Raw magic of all types zoom across

Wood~

a few hundred paces to the west you can hear and see the running water of a 
river that appears to be very wide and very fast moving.  To the east the 
wood seems to thin and more grassland is apparent.
  A road lies to the north while grassland lies to the east, and more wood to 
the south.

Wood~
  You can hear the rushing of water just a ways to the west as a huge river 
flows there.  Its current alone causing the side of the bank to crumble under
its power.  Despite the roar it remains rather peaceful under the protection
of the shaded trees.
  The wood lies to the east and south due to the river slicing it on its

  A small tream cuts through this wood in a southeastern direction.  It is not
wide, nor is it all that fast, allowing it to be easily crossed.  The 
canopy above does provide enough light but you can see that it is fading 
further west into the wood.
  The wood lies all about you.

  A small stream cuts its way flowing to the southeast here, barely visible
in what little light is provided.  It does not flow fast nor is it very wide
and could be easily crossed.  The canopy of the trees cuts out most of the

  The wood lies everywhere, but to the east it seems to be a bit lighter.

  The trees brush close together making a dark scene with the canopy above 
choking out most of the light.  Perhaps it might have been a glimmer in your

not far from you.
  Perhaps a path lies to the west while the wood lies in all others.

moss that adorns every tree, and a small stream that seems to peel away from 
the larger river and begin its meager path traveling southeast.

  The small trees keep out most of the direct sunlight, but some flows through

Darkened wood~
  Looking about this area, as far as you can see in the darkness, there seems
to be a trail that follows this small area in almost a complete circle, or
so you think.
  There could be paths in almost every direction.

Near a tree~
  Branches lie about you as you are in the air next to a tree of some
size.  It would appear that the foilage about you allows you to go up
or down, other than that impossible.

Platform~
  You stand upon a wooden platform built around a large tree trunk.  It is
wide enough to easily hold many people and seems strong enough.  This is
roughly thirty feet in the air, not a good idea to fall down.  The foilage
above it much to thick to allow any further passage.
  Small hanging bridges stray to the north, east and west to other platforms.
A hole in the platform leads into some open air below you.

Grassland~
  The grass here is slightly shorter than that which lies to the west which
appears to rise up around waist height.  The land begins to roll and
further east you can see, miles away, the land becomes very hilly and
possibly even rockier.
  Hills can be seen to the east while grassland lies elsewhere.

Grassland~
  The grass here seems slightly shorter and not quite as thick as that which 
lies to the north.  Miles to the west you can see, perhaps, the edge of a 
wood while looking south the land appears to become quite hilly and even
slightly rockier.
  A wood lies off in the distance to the west while hills lie to the south and
grassland elsewhere.

  The land rolls slightly here as the tall grass that you can see spanning to
the west is twice as high and thick as the small tufts that exist here.  
Large rock outcroppings are becoming more apparent to the east as the hills
get larger and larger.
  A huge expanse of grassland lies to the west and north while the hills lie
elswhere gaining height to the east.

the west is twice as high and thick as the small tufts that exist here.
Large rock outcroppings are becoming more apparent to the east as the hills
get larger and larger.
  A huge expanse of grassland lies to th west while hills lie elsewhere,        
gaining height to the east.

Hills~
  Rolling hills lie all about you seeming to grow higher and rockier to the 
east and south while to the north and west more grassland is apparent and
much less rock.
  Hills lie all about you.

Hills~
  To the north and west you can see a wood that follows around for off in
the distance.  Directly to the south the hills appear to grow larger then 
cutting off abruptly over a huge cliff, which over the edge lies a valley 
enshrouded in mist hundreds of feet below.  
  A wood lies to the north and west far off in the distance while these hills
seem to continue to the east.

  Far to the north, as the hills seem to level off, you think you might see
a wood of sorts.  Elsewhere to the east and west these hills continue and to
the south they seem to grow in height and become more rocky.
  A wood lies far to the north while hills elsewhere.

  The hills seem to span out all around you with small amounts of grass
growing in large clumps partially covered with more occuring rock outcroppings.
The hills seem to grow smaller and more grassy to the north and larger and
more rocky to the south.
  Hills seem to lie all about you.

Hills~
  Small clumps of grass seem to grow infrequently about you having been 
taken over by large rocks and even some as large as boulders.  Not being
able to see over the hills that continue to the east you can only assume 
the continue indefinately.  To the west you can see the hills become lower
in height and less rocky while to the north they seem to drop off into the
grassland.
  Hills seem to lie all about you except to the north where grassland 
continues.

Hills~
  A huge canyon can be seen to the west as the hills seem to fall off into
a deep cliff falling into a canyon enshrouded in mist hundreds of feet below.
To the north the hills seem smaller and more grass is apparent while to the 
south you can hardly see over the next hill.
  Hills lie all about you except to the west where a deep canyon bars travel.

  Small clumps of grass grow about you whereas to the north you can see that
more grass seem to grow on the small hills.  Looking to the south you can 
hardly see over the next hill as they appear to become even more rocky with
rarely any plant growth.

  Reaching the top of a huge hill you can now see far to the east the outline
of a enormous mountain range that stretches to the north and south as far as 
you can see.  The rocks here on these hills are almost all boulders which
makes travel very difficult while to the west the hills don't seem to be as
dangerous.
  Hills lies all about you except to the north where grasslands continue.

you can see.  The rocks here on these hills are almost all boulders which       
makes travel very difficult while to the west the hills don't seem to be as     
dangerous.

Hills~
  Reaching the top of a huge hill you can now see a enormous mountain range 
that travels to your east and then turning to travel along the south side of 
where you are now.  The huge boulders that ordain this hill are very difficult
to travel around.
  Hills lies all about you.

Hills~
  A huge canyon falls from the hills just to the west of where you are 
enshrouded in a mist hundreds of feet below.  Looking to the south you can
see the outline of a huge mountain range that travels to the east and west
far in the distance.
  Hills lie all about you except to the west where a canyon lies.

fallen against the southern area, there grey color strikes hard against the
red rock of the mountainside.  To the north several hills begin in a small
valley, followed quickly by larger hills.
  The only obvious exit from this ravine is north into the rocky valley.

way up the red rock to the east.  To the north numerous spikes of red rock
seem to jutt from the mountain side, while to the south a smaller path leads 
away from the one you are on, either way travel looks more difficult.  
  This road travels further up the mountain to the east while to the west it
slopes downward.

that surrounds you.  Looking far to the north you can see that this small 
path meets up with a larger one which would, perhaps, make travel easier.  This
path does continue to wind its way to the south along the face of the mountain.

  This small path follow the jagged line between the hills to the northwest 
and the mountains to the southeast.  Here, the hills have ended and the 
mountain range begins to thrust its red rock high into the sky, but, the trail
you travel upon is slightly easier than the land around you.
  This path travels north and west while the mountains lie in other directions.

  Following this path to the west you can see that it begins to incline 
slightly, traveleing further into the mountain itself instead of skirting
the hills.  Opposite that the path seems to travel between the ending hills
and the begining of the red rock of the mountain range.
  This path travels east and west while hills lie to the north and mountains
so the south.

the southeast.  Northward you can see that miles of hills lie below you, the
climb down to them would be difficult yet possible.  A ridge lies to the west
as the mountain range seems to have a large ravine cut into it.
  This path travels east and south, along the ravine, while to the north hills

  This small path, which is hardly more than a small cliff of the side of a 
huge mountain, takes a turn to the south and east.  Looking over the cliff to
the west you can see a river that flows out of a darkened wood and falls down
a cliff making a spectacular waterfall that crashes hundreds of feet below
into a mist enshrouded valley.
  This path travels east and south.

  This cliff of a path climbs higher into the mountain the further south it
goes, but the travel does not seem to be any more difficult.  Looking over
the cliff to the west you can see a valley hundreds of feet below, enshrouded
in mist.
  This road travels north and south, where it goes higher up the mountain. 
More of the mountains lie to the east.

  As this small path climbs higher into the mountain, where the cliff used to
fall to the east, now stands more red rock that shoots high into the sky.
Passing by you can see that this part of th trail is much more traveled 
especially around one small area that seems to hold a gate embedded within
the rocken wall that stands some fifty feet high.  Had you not looked closer 
this would have only seemed like part of the mountain itself.
  This path travels north and south.

rock to the northwest and the rising mountain to the southeast.  Travel along
it is easy as it appears that many people travel it daily by the amount of

  This small road seems to travel no where except east from this small spot
within the mountain.  Northward, amesh with the red rock stands a huge gate.
It would appear that the fifty foot tall rock to the north serves as some sort
of a wall to what lies beyond the gate.

  Huge hills that are slowly turning into very rocky mountain lie all about
in every direction except two.  Just to the west of you a cliff drops from this
area hundreds of feet below into a mist enshrouded vally.  To the south it 
would appear that the mountain that rises up above you has a huge face that
rises several hundred feet straight up.

Redspine mountains~
  Small trails amidst the huge boulders and crags can be found which gives 
some light of hope in thraveling thourgh these mountains.  The mountain  
continues ascending to the east while it decends to the west, north and south
are more of the same altitude, just more red rock.
  It appears the mountain ends in some hills to the west while the continues 
up to the east.  More crags and rock lie to the north and south.

to the southeast where the rock ends in a cliff that falls for several 
hundreds of feet to a valley below.  There seems to be a small dusty trail
that leads along this crest to the north while traveling east past some
of the huge rock towers. 
  It looks as though the cliff continues to travel to the northeast, angling

  The small path weaves its way through the towers of rock and crevices here
as you look about the entire area around you, this is the crest of the 
redspine.  Far to the west you can see a expanse of grassland and hills while
to the east a sea of hills is all you see.
  This small path continues down the sides of the mountain to the east and 
west.  A small trail can be made out spawning from the road leading north 
along the crest.

Redspine crest~
  The crest of the mountain looks out over all else here, to the far west
you can see a great expanse of hills and grasslands while to the east there
seems to be no end to the foothills you can see expanding.  Through the rocks
and crags to the south it appears the crest ends and the slope travels down
a bit, as it does to the east and west.
  The mountain decends to the east, west, and south while the crest continues
to the north.

  A cliff drops from the towers of rock and deep crags to the east and south
of you.  Looking over the cliff, as it angles to the northeast and southwest,
there seems to be a valley hundreds of feet below you.  Near the cliff to the
east, past a few huge towers of rock, there appears to be a tall stone 
building made of the red rock and very beautiful. 
  The mountain seems to ascend to the north while decend a bit to the west.
A majestic building seems to have a entrance to the east, past a couple huge
towers of rock.

Redspine mountains~
  Jagged towers of red rock thrust high into the sky while deep crags and
caves reach down into the depths of the mountain.  The face seems to ascend
to the west while it seems to decend slowly to the east.  Travel in any
direction amungst the rock and crag looks very difficult and dangerous.
  More rock and crag lie to the north and south while the mountain face rises
to the west and decends to the east.

Travelers road~
  This small road weaves in and out of huge towers of red rock that thrust
hight into the sky, while evading crags and caves that reach down into the
bowels of the mountain.  Travel here is easier because of the small trail
but in the mountain looks even more dangerous.
  This road decends to the east while ascending to the west.  The red rock
of the redspine lies elsewhere.

  A cliff drops from the towers of rock and deep crags to the east and south
of you.  Looking over the cliff, as it angles to the northeast and southwest,
there seems to be a valley hundreds of feet below you.

  This small path seems to widen out slightly here as it travels to the east
into some foothills, to the east, although, it seems to wind further up in
the mountain and is quickly lost amung the towers of rock.  Travel here looks
easier than it does in the hard red rock around you.
  This path travels up the mountain to the west while begins into some hills
to the east.

  A cliff seems to drop just past a few towers of rock south of you while 
looking to the east into the hills you can see that the cliff continues for
some way.  Perhaps, far in the distance there might be a trail leading down,
but that only caught you eye for a second.
  Some hills are beginning to form to the east of you while the mountain rises
to the west.

  Huge towers of red rock span into the sky near caves and crags that
reach into the soul of the mountain.  Looking down the mountain side to the
west there looks as though a cliff falls off not to far from you and it
would appear as though a small trail lies near this cliff.  The mountain
rises further to the west and south.
  The redspine lies all about you.

Redspine mountains~
  Huge towers of red rock thrust out from the mountainside while other areas
have caved in making huge crevices and cracks.  Travel amungst these
elements is very difficult, every step must be watched carefully or you would
find yourself inside a bottomless crevice.  The mountain face is very
steep and ascends to the east while slopes off to the west and desecends.  
Looking about you there seems to be a small dusty trail that leads to the
north and to the east up the mountain.

elements is very difficult and even more dangerous, one wrong step and you
could find yourself at the bottom of a endless crag.
  The mountain ascends to the south while decends to the north, elsewhere lies
more of the jagged red rock.

Redspine crest~
  The crest of the redspine seems to continue far out of your vision to the
east while to the west it seems to drop off quickly at a cliff.  The jagged
rock leads down both sides of the mountain to the north and south at very
steep angles making travel very difficult.
  The redspine lies all about you except to the west where a cliff falls off
into a valley below.

Redspine crest~
  The crest of the redspine continues to the east and west through jagged
pieces of rock and shallow crags.  This high up you can see well about you,
to the north there appears to be a expanse of grasslands while to the south
there appears to be a sea.  Also, far to the south, a single mountain spire
raises high above even your height, into the clouds above.
  The redspine decends to the north and south while the crest continues to

Redspine mountains~
  Jagged towers of red rock jutt out all around you making travel here very
difficult not to mention dangerous.  One wrong step and you could be at the
bottom of one of the crags that litter the mountain side burrowing into the
bowels of the mountain.  There appears to be a trail futher down the mountain
that edges a cliff, north and west continueing south.
  The redspine lies all about you while to the west the mountain side seems
to ascend a bit.

Redspine mountains~
  Jagged towers of red rock thurst out from the mountainside where caves
and crags burrow deep within the mountain itself.  Just to the west a cliff
falls from the mountain side, ending at a valley far below.  Elsewhere, the 
mountain seems to ascend to the north and decend to the south while the 
jagged rock continues making travel very difficult.

  Jagged towers of red rock thrust high into the sky while deep crags and
caves burrow into the bellows of the mountain side itself.  The mountain
seems to ascend to the north while other areas are simpy rocky, the
ascention and decention are not enough to make a felt difference.
  The redspine lies all about you.

  You are on a road that winds through a dense forest.  From the west you can
hear the sound of a swiftly moving river, and to the east the forest lightens
and gives way to grassy plains.  It becomes darker as you travel further
into the woods due to the dense foliage above you.  The road itself appears to
be well traveled by both animals and people.

Covered Bridge~
  You are walking through a covered bridge that crosses the river.  The roar
of the river is loud here, and echos resonate inside the bridge.  Large windows
in the north and south walls allow a brisk breeze to pass through, carrying
with it much of the rivers moisture.
  The bridge continues to the west, and to the east you see a clearing and the
travelers road.

Forest Riverbank~
  Dry leaves crackle underfoot as you walk amongst the scattered oaks and
birches.  Occasionally you catch sight of a small forest animal scampering
through the thick underbrush covering the ground around the trees.  The forest
becomes quite dense to the north, and the ground is rocky and hilly.  To the
east you can see a wide river flowing southwestward.
  You are surrounded by dense forest except to the east, where the ground drops
off sharply towards the river.

  You are on a rock covered beach on the western side of a horseshoe bend in

easily lower a boat into to safely enter the river.  Though swift, the river
does not seem too fast or rough at this point to prevent travel up or
downstream.  A small waterfall trickles down the stones to your north, and
flows into one of the pools.

large pool leading into the river to the south.

  The thicket continues to the south, where you can see more briars, and to
the east and north you believe you can exit back into the forest proper.  The
thorns and underbrush are too thick for you to pass through them to the west.

Blackberry thicket~
  Briars and dead plants catch on your clothing and armor as you force your
way through the blackberry bushes here.  Most of the blackberries seem to have
been picked already, as all you've noticed are the thorns.  It is very
difficult to move around in here.
  The thicket continues to the north and east, where you can see more briars.
The underbrush and thorns are too thick for you to pass through them to the
west or south.

Deadly rocks~
  You push boldly forward, choosing not to give way to your better sense.  The
water boils around you, and your craft is tossed roughly about.  Suddenly, you
find yourself heading unstoppably towards a large outcrop of huge rocks in
the middle of the river.  You try frantically to regain control, but to no
avail...obviously it is best to be slow and careful in the rapids...your boat
suddenly is shot high into the air, skimming over the rocks.  You crash into
a section of the river without quite so many rocks, and amazingly manage to
keep from falling overboard.  You are safe...this time.
  It seems that you should just let the current carry you through the rapids.

as it is dashed to splinters upon the hard stone.  The river grabs ahold of
you, sucking you under into its wet, deadly embrace, forcing the air from your
lungs.  Air...precious air.... You briefly surface, and gasp for another
breath, just as your head is mauled against something hard.
  The world goes black, and you sink forever into a watery grave.

  You are floating westward down a wide, calm river.  The current here is not
too strong, and it is possible to paddle upstream if you wish.  The banks are
steep, and lined with a variety of trees on both sides.  Occasionally you can
also discern a stone and thatch home along the bank.  A long stone bridge
spans the river here, and you will be floating under it soon.  Past the bridge
on the north shore you see a place where several boats have been pulled
ashore.

  A building lies a distance to the north, but you can see no entrance into 
it.  Looking to the east you can see that the grass becomes incredibly high
and very difficult to travel through.  Another large building lies to the 
southwest of here.  To the east, just on the fringe of the deep grassland
there appears to be a large farm of sorts with several small barns.
  Grassland lies in all directions except north and east where a farm lies.

Looking eastward the grassland becomes savage and long, making travel very 
difficult.

a new temple has been hastily construced.  A large arch gives access into 
the large building.

Chapel~
  This building is rather crudely constructed form various pieces of formed
rock and large clumps of packed mud.  Despite its archaic build the 
building itself holds some sort of peace to it, almost as if there was 
someone here besides those that stand next to you.  Various plaques have
been placed upon the walls and it is obvious that someone has been trying
to make several glass windows stained with color.
  Each wall of the temple has a arch leading into the grassland except to

  The flat expanse of the grassland lies about you.  Through the tall, thick
grass you think you might see a break in the layer miles to the south.
Everywhere else is just the sweet smell of nature, and a sea of flowing
grassland.  There appears to be a building to the east, although there doesn't
appear to be a entrance.
  A road lies to the south while grassland elsewhere except to the east where
a home lies.

  The walls of this building have been covered with different styles of 
robes and other types of dress.  Near each style of robe is a staff of 
sorts intermixed with different dagger and small blade.  A table covered
in clothe lies along the northern wall of this chamber.
  There is a door on the southern wall.

no apparent entrance.  There also appears to be a building to the west, but
again there doesn't appear to be a entrance.

  A large archway leads north to a dark vault.  An old stench eminates from it,
as dust seems to continually flow from the old arch.  There is a small tunnel 
that travels east into a darkness.

sided by a luminious peak that hangs hundreds of feet above you.  Looking 
closely you think you can see a castle nestled somewhere up there.  To the 
south past the small fence stands a lone house enshrouded in a wood slightly
past it.
  This road continues to the east and west while a home lies to the south.

Keeps Way~
  Here the smal road follows the peak to the north and west as the base rounds
out.  Not far from the road to the east there is a large building that looks
as though it could be a barracks of some sort.  A small path off the south of
this street is a small alcove with some benchs to sit on.
  This road continues to the north and west while a barracks lies to the east 
and a small square lies to the south.

to the south while to the north a huge cliff rises up above you.
  This forest continues to the east and south while any travel to the west is

There are rags and hay piled in one corner of the room and looks as though

waterfall, crashing hundreds of feet below.  A small set of slippery stairs
can be seen just to the left of the flow, leading down the cliff.

tree trees roots~
  The roots have formed a tangled mess that allows only minimal sight and 
hardly any movement at all.  It is impossible to see where the roots, or
the trees originate from, it is as if they all are from the same tree, hard
black bark, and almost moving as you look at them.

mist~
  The mist makes vision even more difficult as it seems to grow thicker 
with each layer of mist that flows toward the canopy not far above you.

  Waves lap continously, although they never quite reach the wall of 
gnarled roots and trees that don't even reach out to the salty water.  The
beach continues for some distance to the east, although to the west it 
appears to end at a cliff made of grey rock.  The mist from the valley to
the north begins to disapate here, letting in much more light.
  The beach continues to the east while you may be able to push through the
gnarled roots nad trees to the north.

  The sand of this beach is gritty and hard as the waves continually lap
up against it matting it with fresh salt water.  The gnarled wood to the 
north doesn't reach far enough to tough the water although, the mist that
blocks the valley above the treeline now begins to disapate, leaving only 
a humid feeling.

the north, this small makeshift outpost appears to be prospering, and dry.
This wall seems to form a semi-circle around this encampment inside of which
you can see boats being built and several buildings standing tall.  There
even seems to be a small worn path in the sand that serves as some sort of 
a village road.
  The shelled beach lies to the south while a worn path in the sand takes you
north into this small outpost.  There seems to be some writing on a large 
piece of driftwood hanging over you.

Sandy path~
  So many feet have tread upon this sand that it has become hardened and 
almost resembles a path.  Just to the west of you there appears to be a huge
area in which boats are being built.  They seem to be of all sizes, ranging
from a huge galley to a small canoe.  The boatyard seems to take up much of 
the area encased within he driftwood wall, although the eastern side seems
to hold several buildings and huts.  Further to the north there appears to 
be a large podium of sorts upon which stand several people.
  A large boatyard seems have residence to the west while another worn path
seems to trail off to the east, passing just outside what appears to be the
buildings of this outpost.

  You can see that the buildings to the east seem to make up more of a 
marketplace than anything else.  It looks as though they are buildings 
crumpled together so tightly you could walk out of one building and end up
directly into another.  There is a odd music that radiates throughout this
entire area, possibly coming from the marketplace.  There are numerous boats
to the west inside of the huge boatyard that takes up most of the western
side of the village.
  This worn path continues north and south while to the east you could enter
into the marketplace and westward takes you into the boatyard.

it turns around the circular room.  A archway leads east from this simplistic
room as it holds nothing but the golden morter that it has been built from.

him now around six feet in hieght and hardly hindered by the huge tail that

that he has built, and again in a seperate part he plants a seed which soon
grows into a field of prosperous crops.  Not far from the field the metalic
skinned lizards reproduce and grow, each learning from a elder who learned 
from the lizard of golden skin.

reaching the city.  The lizards with their once glistening skins already
scream from ash that covers them blocking out the light which once shined so
bright.  On the far side of the mountain it looks as though you can see a
army of black skinned lizards forming to march upon the city.  The army is
led by one larger lizard, skin tainted a reddish color, mounted upon a 
huge beast of some sort.

  A huge reddish skinned lizard passes from a dark wood into a land rich 
with farm and homes.  Looking about him it takes no more than a glance
for all to be destroyed by his large claws and savage jaw.  Other lizards,
skin colored bronze and silver fall by his hand, those week of will join
him in his destruction, wanting to live and destroy rather than die.  The
reddish skinned lizard and his new found army continue their journey of 
destruction across the land until they arrive at a enourmous walled city.
The army travels upon a blackened mound almost as high as a mountain, the
top of which spews forth black ash and reddish mist.

  This is the obvious top of the pyramid shape that this temple occupies.
Near the top, where four walls come together in a point, a sconce hangs on
several strong chains providing ample light from what lies within.  Almost
directly below the sconce there stands a altar made from the gnarled wood
of the forest.  Its branches seem to be coated with blood and small peices
of flesh that have clung to it.  The rest of the chamber seems to be clad
in various rugs and other materials to make it a facade of laviousness.

  The white sand of the beach seems to be intermixed with mounds of ash and
large pieces of wood that seem to be nothing but raw coal now.  Waves from 
a ocean crash from the south while to the north there appears to be a 
desolate valley, burnt and enshrouded with a smokey mist.
  The beach continues east and south while the desolate valley lies north
and a river still flows to the east.

Underwater cavern~
  Long strands of sea weed hang down from the roof of this large cavern,
each seemingly intertwined with one another taking up at least the top ten
feet of this cavern roof.  Through various breaks in the weeds above you
can see the grey rock from the slight shimmering glow given off by the
lichen far below.

Water chamber~
  Deep water lies about you, feeling down there is no obvious bottom though
a quick dive reveals that there is indeed a bottom made of grey stone almost
twenty feet down.  The water within is very cold and dark, within it small
fish or other entities seem to rub up against you often enough to make one 
wonder.  A stone door can be made out through the waters to the north.
  The chamber continues east and south while a door lies northward.

Water filled chamber~
  This chamber is filled entirely with the dark waters of this odd temple,
small bubbles of air seem to rise from the moss and lichen that rests upon
the coarse walls as they give off their meager yet life giving light.  About
this chamber you can see many beds of sea weeds which seem to be partly
floating, held down by small pieces of coral.
  A stone door lies southward.

Path~

incased in a stone wall some twenty feet high.  There does, however, appear
to be a gate directly at the end of this path.  It would appear, by the 
rubble on the path, that no one has been here in a long time.
  The path leads north to a gate while south into the mountains.

Travelers Road~
  The weather worn road makes its waye east and west
through a great expanse of hills. Far off to the south
the highest tips of the Black Mountains loom like a
shadow over the horizon. To the west the peaks of the
Redspine Mountains rise into the sky. 
  Two humble wooden buildings can be seen to the side of
the road over the next eastern rise.

Travelers Road~
  Two dumpy wooden buildings line this part of the road.
Signs hang over the doors of both; one reads "Supplies"
and the other reads "The Travelers Rest". 
  Beyond the buildings there is nothing save for hills
and the road.

  Looking north you stare through the dirty glass window of the
supply shop. It is very dim inside and you cant see very much.
The wares displayed in the window pass for useable at least.

  The Travelers Rest is a seedy looking inn. More from wear and time
than from the upkeep it recieves. A large door is centered on its
porch. The word "welcome" is painted in faded letters above the door
frame.

Under the bridge~
  The Rainwash runs directly under an ancient stone bridge here.
Looking to the sides of the bridge you can see no trail or road
leading to or from it attesting to the age of the bridge.
  At one time the bridge was incarntately designed with many 
carvings and inscriptions. Now all the decoration has faded to
mere lines and bumps along the surface.

On the bridge~
  You are standing at the crest of the old stone bridge. Looking 
about you a great view of the hills and the lands surrounding
is given. 
  Off to the west the rust colored Redspine Mountains rise into the
heavens. Likewise the darker range of the Black Mountains rises into
the sky further off to the south. The waters of the Rainwash River
run eastward under the bridge; on their long journey to the ocean
far off to the east.         
  Other than that there is nothing to see except for hill after 
hill rising and falling in the distance.

of the peaks of the Balck Mountains can be seen.
  On the face of the hill upon which you are standing is a dark
cave. Looking down at it you smell an awful stench reeking out
of it. To inspect further you need to walk down the side of the
hill and around to its face.
  To the north the waters of the Rainwash River can be seen. An
old stone bridge crosses them.

Inside the cave~
  The scent in this cave is horrid. Flies buzz around a few fresh 
corpses. Bones litter much of the area. A vast collection of broken
weapons and armors is heaped up in the back of the cave. A tattered
skin is spread across part of the floor. The opening to the cave leads
out to the south.

corpses~
  The corpses are of a few humans who look to be of the adventurer type.
Unfortuneately for them they weren't strong enough to withstand the 
might of the hill giants. Dried, cracking blood is all over their flesh
and the floor about them.
~

weapons~
  A small heap of weapons of all sorts lies on the ground. Most of them
are broken. None of the ones that are whole look useable to any but 
the most meager of warriors.
~

armors~
  Intermixed with the weapons are various pieces of armor and shields. They
are all dented and worthless.
~
E
skin~
  The skin is a patchwork of a number of smaller skins. It covers the most
of the back part of the cave's floor. With a brooding fealing of horror
you realize that the skin is that of various humanoids; much like your
own.

peaks of the Black Mountains.

The Rainwash River~
  Water flows rapidly in an eastern direction away from the 
Redspine Mountains, which lie to the west. The current is strong,
making it impossible to swim this river.
  To the south you can see endless hills covering the most of your
view. Way off in the south you can barely make out the highest
peaks of the Black Mountains.

The Rainwash River~
  Water flows rapidly in an eastern direction away from the
Redspine Mountains, which lie to the west. The current is strong,
making it impossible to swim this river.
  To the south you can see endless hills covering the most of your
view. Way off in the south you can barely make out the highest 
peaks of the Black Mountains.

Scandra's Supply Shop~
  This small and dingy shack displays a great variety of items that
might prove useful to the traveler. Shelves full of various necessitys
line every wall. Crates are piled up in somewhat neat stacks around
the floor to display their contents.
  Against the northern wall of the room is a small counter. Behind that
counter is a shelf displaying a few of the more valueable items. A door
lies behind that counter. 
  The quality of the wares is acceptable, but surely nothing exceptional.
The wares displayed to the street in the window were a fairly accurate
account of what is available. 
  The door to the Travelers Road is south of you.

hills. To the east, you can see the edge of a vast forest poking 
itself over the tops of some closer hills. Southward the Black 
Mountains rise to the heavens. Far off to the west the highest
peaks of the Redspine Mountains can be seen.
  North of you, the waters of the Rainwashh River run eastward
through the hills and into the forest.

The Rainwash River~
  Water flows rapidly to the east here. Swimming without a boat is
certainly impossible. High hills line the sides of the river, blocking
your vision.
  You can however see a great forest to the east. Over the tops of 
the hills you can also see the Black Mountains to the south, and the
Redspine Mountains to the west.

  You are standing on the northeastern edge of a great plain of hills. 
Far, far off to the west the rust colored peaks of the Redspine Mountains
are barely visible. Southward you can see the Black Mountains dominate
the southern skyline. A great forest is directly east of this last hill
on which you stand. The foilage looks dense and hardly passable.
  South of you there is also the Rainwash River. Running its course
eastward and into the forest.

The Rainwash River~
  The river is now running past the eastern edge of the hills. Directly
to your east the river runs into darkness under the eaves of the trees.
There are no paths apparent at the sides of the river in the forest.
  Two great mountain ranges can be seen from here. Far to the west
lie the Redspine Mountains, almost a similar distance to the south
lie the Black Mountains. Between the mountains and your current location,
nothing save for hills is to be seen.

The Travelers Rest~
  The air in this building is a bit hard to breathe. Between the smell
of alcoholic drinks and the lingering scent of burning lamp oil there
is little room for the true air to be breathed. 
  The room itself is fairly simple. There are five tables arranged 
randomly around the place. Each table has four chairs tucked under
it. On the eastern side of the room a long wooden bar with a number
of stools lines the wall. Behind the bar is a large sign displaying
the available drinks.
  An open doorway to the south leads to the back half of the inn, 
where travelers go to attain a room for the evening.

The Travelers Rest~
  Standing in the back part of the inn you find that the air is much more
pure and easier to breathe. There is a small desk here, resting beside
the entrance to a long hallway that runs down the back of the inn.
  A few wooden floorboards creak and groan as you walk up to the desk
but the place has a strudy and stubbor feal to it as a whole. As you
approach the desk you notice a small sign resting on the corner of it.

Outside the temple~
  The field here is dominated by the frontal face of what is obviously a
large temple. Two large iron doors center the temple. The form of a whip
with six barbed hooks clawing out of the ends of its heads is carved into
both of the doors. Above the doors is a large statue. The temple is made 
from stone and bears little decoration. To the east and west the field leads
away from the face of this somber temple.

  The doors and their carving are not crude, nor are they delicate features
of art. They seem to be just there serving their purpose. Looking
closer at the carving you see some runes written in the Old Tongue that
translate roughly into "The House of the Lady Lovitar".

The floor and cieling are made from the same dull grey stone. There is no 
decoration at all in this place. Light is provided from two torches that 
hang to the sides of the entryway. 
  Long halls lead off to the north, east and west; each lighted by torches
that hang every twenty feet or so on the walls. The halls to the east and
west both terminate after a visible distance, taking a turn to the north.
The northern hall leads past a few doorways and into a large open room
that is not very visible at this distance.
  To the south is the exit of the temple.

A torch here and there provides light, but there is no decoration or

  A similar view is given to the west. The only difference is that there

  Whoever made this place had no taste for the asthetic. All there is to see
is dull stone and torchlight.

the walls. It is impossible to grasp the nature of the figures due to

in the air. It has a thick and spicy quality to it. 
  Evil pours from the area. It seems focused on the slab. It is just now
that you notice leather straps attached to the corners of the slab. The
idea that it might be a sacrificial table seems quite valid right now.
  To the south there is a large hanging veil. Behind that veil is what

and stinging your eyes.  Outside a cracked and dusty window can be seen the
barren Puyallup.  The wall to the right has righting on it in black marker.
An ebony and steel necked guitar rests carefully against a weather beaten
mahogony desk. A large door leads southward.

                  The Ritual, to the Best of my Recollection
                                by -H-

         From the focus of my heart, I call the words
         Of anger spoken and desire revealed
         By my challenge of word and deed
         By my blood consecrate thy bane invoked
         Thy shape and form decreed never was.
                          -@-
         On thy physical form, I call the words of rendering.
         On thy hates, I invoke justice, the anger unappeased.
         On thy past in shadows, I shine the light revealed.
         On thy loves and joys, I gift seperation.
         On thy spirit, I speak abandonment.
         On thy future, I bring fear and grief.
         On thee I invoke all.
                          -@-
         The winds shall erase thy name
         The sands the traces of thy path
         The sun the coolness of thy shadow
         And unto the waters I command thy essence
         Thy shape and form decreed never was

Above the Southwind Tower~
   You are above a large, forty story skyscraper.  It's roof has
collapsed, showing what used to be a plush office below you, but is now
filled with dust and rotting furniture.  The winds from the barren plains
of the puyallup buffet you, and howl about the eaves of the deserted
building.

you can see the stairs winding themselves all the way up as far as you
can see.  A dank, musty smell pervades this area and water is quietly
dripping into a stagnant puddle in the corner.  A door to the south,
hanging slightly ajar, reads "Lobby".

the wind howls through the ragged holes and sweeps the dust and sand about 
the once plush carpeting, now gone threadbare and dirty.  A reception
desk is here, rotting away and covered with dust.  To the north is a metal
door, hanging slightly ajar, that reads "Stairs".  To the west is an 
elevator door with an "Out of Order" sign hanging on it.

You can see from these obstacles the children play with, how
they get there savagery and cannibalistic urges towards
humans.
  The edge of the platform to the south and east is barracaded
with a semi-tall fence made from thin trees.  The platform
spreads out to the north and rounds off to the west.

Thistle Rows~
  You stand on a path between two towering thistle bushes that are in blossom
right now, the air is filled with a bittersweet smell.  The bushes here grow to
an amazing height, creating a gothic veil which hangs just inches above your
head.  To the north, through a gap in the bushes, a stone structure can be
seen, but the bushes to the north make travel in that direction almost
impossible, while to the south, a worn path leads to a large cluster of trees.
The bushes prevent travel to the east or west, although you hear the faint
sound of a stream to the west.

out over an area devode of trees.  A faint path can be seen leading northward
around a patch of thistle bush, it looks untraveled for quite some time.

Top of spiral stair~
  You breathe heavily as you look down the magnificent staircase.  It's a long
way to walk for mortal men/women.  Small candles illuminate this area and it
becomes very quiet.  So quiet you can hear your heart beat.
  Down lies a Spiral Staircase.
  To the North you see a large archway leading into a Magnificent Chamber.

Black crag~
  Rocks of the black mountains rise up about you making this trail a very 
ominous one to be traveling on.  Through the dark rock you can make out
deep crags which tumble far beneath you, almost forcing you to keep a constant
step or be flung far below to your death.

Before a castle~
  The rock of the black mountains almost forms what stands tall before you.
Black ebon walls of a keep rise high into the sky from the rock which supports
it, yet holds no lighter color.  One large portculis bars entrance into this
keep of darkness, the rock of the mountains prevents any travel other than
down the trail northward.

upon the western wall looks out upon the dark skin of the mountain side, 
nothing seems to reflect which only adds to the dreary complection of this
lost mans palace.
  Archs lie east and south.

what little light comes into this chamber as they endure continually their
solemn darkness.
