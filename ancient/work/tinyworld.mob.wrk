  He has a very sad look on his face as he turns his neck toward you.  Now you
can see why he is kept here, a chain has been tied to the wall of this chamber
and around the dragons neck.  It appears to be made of copper which gives the
reason why the dragon hasn't simple burned it off.  If he were to burn the 
chain it would in turn burn himself, and looking at his neck it appears he has
found this out the hard way.
