Hiya Cyric,

Another instalment of ideas for the mud, [ya i know your bombarded with stuff,
but ya did say you like hearing new ideas, I don't mind not getting a response,
but if my messages do get to be too much let me know so I dont bug ya]
[yep i'm a designer at heart and a player wanna be....grin]
And I also know you wont be adding much to the game til you get all the current
bugs fixed. I'm just adding to your growing list of ideas.

Silence [ability/spell] vs other characters....ability for higher level chars
   which are on all the time to silence chars up to level 4 who start being
   abusive, wouldnt do anything harmful, just no shout and no tell for a few
   minutes.  would have to work in no magic zones though....to prevent the 
   people who come on for a minute or to just to swear up a storm with tells
   and shouts, and not risk anything cause its a char that they will only play
   that one night.

Should level leveling masters always level people for free? i'm sure that the
higher level masters would ask for 
*clerics* donations to thier temple
*warriors* time in servitude, or its financial equivilent...hey ive got a
           castle to maintain
*mages* magic ingredients or talismans or its financial equivilent, my reasarch
        doesn't come cheap ya know
*thief* -what are you kidding? a thief not wanting a percentage of the profits?
*rangers* if he has no keep, yep should do it for free [hmm another bonus of
          being a ranger] if he has one, see warrior above.
Heck to make things even more insane and put more work [egads] into it, why
let both good and evil people be trained by the same people. grin

Hermit slap, slap the hermit and he moves away so combat isn't so scary for 
      silly reasons.

Could the score be split into to 2 commands? or maybe the huconditional stuff
          be put at the end with the spells? like hungry/thirsty/nosummon/notell
          etc. its rather difficult for us high levelers to find out if we are
          hungry or not.  [its hard to check our stomachs {food - are you in
          there?..grin}]

damn just read the concept of a full register mud. i will note that this wont
solve shouts or tells in that they are typicly done by chars in the inn
with a new char that has nothing to lose.  Typically they dont even leave the
inn.  I dont quite know the purpose of your full registered mud, other than
with this a few people can kill any unwary character of any level, you will
note that no character has made it anywhere after registering. I stil think
the silence ablility would solve this problem, shrug
