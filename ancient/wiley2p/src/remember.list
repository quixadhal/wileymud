for the spell turn to work, you must have the mobiles race as either bing
undead or ghost, this is the only way it will work....

room #3 must be a no exit room, call it storage_room, it is a blank
room for storing things needed in the code

mobiles used in polymorph spell must be kept in room #3 also, they are moved
to where the cast is and the cast is moved to where the mobile was
