**Lan: feels like home?
**Lan: maybe a Ranger skill could be awareness? You could sense mobs coming when they were in the square next to you
**Lan: Not the specific type, just that  somehting is moving to the west, etc.
**Lan: maybe when you  die, you won't need to have more exp to gain then you would if you just gained a level
**Lan: It seems to me that I am always running into people who have just cleaned out an area. Perhaps it would be possible to make a few more areas for levels 4
**Lan: 4-12? I am ususally helping lower levels, so its tough to get them exp when everything is dead...
