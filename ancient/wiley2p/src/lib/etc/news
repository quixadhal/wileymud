     New Commands - 
        Land:	  Allows a mage to put his feet on the ground :)
		    Thanks goes to Belle!

        nosummon  - allows you to choose if another player can summon
                    you.

        noteleport - see nosummon.

        Monsters combat has been changed, monsters that recieve
        more then one attack per round, or are allowed to use fighter
        moves will do so only on their first attack, all other attacks
        should be normal combat, thanks to Goodwind and others for
        pointing this out to me.

        The Spells, armor, shield, stoneskin have been changed.  Armor
        and shield will work in combination, but stonskin will not work
        with either of the other to, this is due to stoneskins resistance
        to piercing weapons.

        Reboots will now occur at both 1 a.m. and 1 p.m.
