SKILL SKILLS

    There is a new commands added called skills, it will show you
  your rating in the new skills for the game.

    There are new skills included in the game and there should more
  to come with time.  The tutor in various towns can teach you these
  skills and perhaps even commoners you may adventure to find.

  Skills have been broken up into two categories.

  1.  Passive
  2.  Active

  Passive skills are those that are always being used without you having
  to issue a specific command to make them act on you or another.  Various
  rolls are made against your knowledge of the skills to see if they aid
  you in what every action you are taking.  Never will a skill hinder you
  if you fail a roll, the most you can expect is that the normal affects
  will take place as if you never had the skill at all. 

  Active skills are those that you must invoke on your own.  These skills
  are activated by using the skill name and usually including an arguement
  for the skill to act on.

  See ACTIVE, PASSIVE for a skill list
#
PASSIVE

  Swimming : If proficient in swimming, the player having this passive skill
    will not have to spend as much movement while moving through shallow water.
    Water that normally can be walked through, not water that is too deep and
    requires a boat to traverse.  This skills is benefitial if you must leave
    your frigate off of shore due to the shallows.  Yes, frigates are being
    made for cross ocean journeys.

  Endurance: A player proficient with endurance has a good chance of
    maintaining his/her stamina in a fight.  This skill coincides with a 
    players constitution and what percent of their hits have been left. 
    All classes will benefit from this skill.

  Deciphering: This skill aids those that wish to read the arcane works of
    magic and have a better chance of understanding the spell that is written.
    All classes will benefit from this skill.  Because you are a castor does
    not mean you have the ability to read other spells besides the ones you
    know. Essentially this is the fabled 'READ MAGIC' but applies to all 
    classes that wish to use scrolls other then recall.

  Two_Hand: All characters may and most likely will wield weapons two-handed
    in this world.  A mage can apply this to a staff, a cleric to a hammer..
    you get the point.  Because you wield a weapon two-handed, you may not 
    use a shield nor hold something in your hand, punch will not work while
    doing this also.  This skill improves the chance that you will maintain 
    your grip on your weapon when a foe tries to disarm you, it will also aid
    you in damaging your enemy slightly more since you are now applying all
    of your upper body to the blow.  Characters and still be disarmed even
    with this skill though, no one is 100% proficient.

  Bare_Hand: All characters may attack with no weapon at all, doing minor damage
    plus any additional strength that might apply.  With this skill a player has
    essentially learned how to box and can now utilize this knowledge when faced
    with a battle without a weapon.  This skill also works along with the skill
    punch, aiding in accuracy and force for the blow.

  Spell_Craft: A spell caster with this skill has the chance to understand a
    spell even better once successfully cast.  When a player successfully casts
    a spell, a 2% bonus is added on up until 50% in the spell is achieved.
    The skill Spell Craft will add in an extra amount to this percent based
    on how well you know this art.

  Meditation: The act of meditating and being able to focus ones self aids in
    the recovery of both mana and health, a player with meditation can earn
    these two amounts back faster while resting or sleeping. A must for any
    that wishes to stay in style with the monks of the redspines.

#
ACTIVE
  Riding: This skill allows you to mount a beast and make it carry you
    and the supplies you have.  type help mount for more info.

  Bandage: An active skill in the art of medicine.  A player with this skill
    has the chance of reviving a fallen comrade in battle by applying knowledge
    learned through practice.  This skill is a must for those that do not
    have the god given powers of healing.

  Track: SEE TRACK

  Punch: Bare knuckle brawling is the best type of fun any can find!
    Punch aids those that can not seem to hang onto their weapon in
    battle, or those that do not wish to wield a weapon at all.
    The skill bare hand aids in this offensive skill greatly along
    with any str bonus that might be applied.  Those that wear
    gloves of some sort have been known to knock an opponent down
    to his knees, only to never see the light of day.

  Apraise : This skill give minor information on an object that is
    either a weapon, armor, or light source.  Message depicting
    the relative value of the object and information that is
    unique to each object.  Apraise on a weapon will give its
    weapon class, for the fighters that can specialize in that
    class.  For a torch, it will give the hours left to burn.
    On armor, it will show the Effective and True Armor class
    of the object.  If the True and Effective armor classes are
    not the same, it is time to get the armor repaired. This
    can also be done by just looking at the armor.

  DoorBash: A player with this skill has a chance to break down
    a door by the shear force aplied by hurling their body into it.
    This is a tiring skill and can even damage you if not careful.
    Ever bashed a door down and found that no floor was on the other
    side? (HINT)

#
MOUNT

  This command goes along with the RIDING skill you may learn.
  When you find a beast you wish to try and mount, type...

  mount <beast name>

  Depending on how well you know riding, and the disposition of the
  creature will determine if you are able to ride it or not.
  When mounted, you lose no movement points, except for those in
  combat, you have some spell capabilities, and some skills will
  not be usable when mounted, the same will apply towards some
  skills that are not usable to a person when mounted.
  You do not have control of the beast to the point of being able
  to issue orders to it, you may however simply type the direction
  you wish to travel and the mount shall carry you there.

  This is still experimental, all bug reports are welcome and encourged
  to help get this ironed out as fast as possible.  Comments and suggestions
  are also welcome.

  I am planning on make a stable, where you may take your mount (pet?)
  to be boarded, this way you can come back on the game and pick you
  mount (pet?) up with ot having to venture out to find another.


#
SPELL SPELLS

    Spells are the backbone of the magic user and the strict guidelines of
  many cleric religions.  Spells which a magic-using class can use are
  listed in the practices when one gains a level in their magic-using class.
  Clerics will find being extremely good will allow them to heal the
  appropriate amount while being evil will allow the cleric to harm targets
  quite well, yet they will suffer in their healing abilities.
  Please do not be dismayed about not seeing a entire spell list, simply
  ask those that are of higher levels if your curiousity gets the best of
  you.

    One can find out more about spells by 'help <spell>', if the reply comes
  back not in the help files please 'bug <spell name>'.

    Cyric and staff have taken great aims to make the spells in Wiley as
  close to the spells on would find in any players handbook for AD&D.  If
  you find that a spell is totally different than one you would find within,
  please 'bug <problem>'.

    More spells are being added constantly for all magic-using classes, 
  if you would like to see a unusual spell use the 'idea <spell>' to add
  it to our possibilities.

#
SPEC SPECIALIZATION

  Fighters may specialize in a weapon class of their chose, this is done
  by choosing the class you wish to become proficient with and spending
  the training in that class.  This is a passive skill that aids when
  in combat.  The normal +1 hit and +2 damage applies if a succesful
  skill roll is made while attacking.  The fighter may specialize
  in any one or more classes that are available at the time of
  training.  You may use the apraise command to look at different
  weapons to see if it may aid you in your type of specialization or
  not.

RULES

Player Killing:  The only way you may engage in combat with another player

  make a note to the board indicating what was done.

  unless both you and the victim have been registered to kill other
  players.

  to perform some act that will violate the stated rules or rules that
  have been posted or conveyed by a Immortal will result in the
  deletion of your character.

  running with, I ask that you only have one character on the game at
  once.  You may have another character to use as storage, but both
  character should not be on the game at the same time except when at
  one of the renting locations.  This clause is ONLY for exchanging items

MOBILES

    Mobiles, or monsters, in wiley have much the same stats as a player of
    there equal level.  Some mobs out there are simply going about their 
    business while others are out to gain items and exp like a average player.
    Mobiles have classes and class abilities just like you, so if you plan
    to bash a bandit, be ready to see one in return.  One of the advantages
    a player has over a mob is their ability to group randomly.  Mobs do this
    but only on rare ocasions.

	the magickal arts.

  The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned. To bash
someone is to attempt to 'knock' that person over. If you succeed you
will inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on its rear.
The victim will be unable to issue any commands for 2 rounds of
violence. If you miss you loose your balance and fall.

WARRIOR FIGHTER

     Warriors are the strong fighters of the realm.  Generally they take 
   jobs in the mercenary fields or perhaps guards of a city or town.  
   They live and die by the blade that they have chosen their own, although
   seem to take a few with them when they go.
     Warriors are the ultimate fighting machines and there skills justify it
   as so.  They are allowed to practice several effective combat tactics
   including kick, bash, rescue, and disarm.  Warriors of higher levels 
   also see the benefit of multiple attacks.

#
THIEF
  Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other
class offers.  Many of these qualities can come in handy in many
situations, such as picking locks.  They are not very combat oriented,
however, so do not expect to be able to kill many things by yourself.
The useful aspect of thieves involves their ability to scout ahead,
avoiding monsters, detecting and removing traps and selling and buying
items at the black market.
   You can improve you skills by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
CLERIC
  This class gives you the wisdom of peace, blessing and healing,
though it is possible to learn more violent spells.  You can improve
your spells by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
MAGIC USER WIZARD MAGE
  This is the class of powerful and violent magic, but the magic user
does not control the nature, and can therefore not bless and such. You
can improve your spells by using the practice command.

See also: PRACTICE
#
RANGER
     
     This class gives you both the strength of the fighter, but the wisdom
   and peace of a priest.  It is rumored that the gods of the woods look
   favorably on those that keep a GOOD outlook on life, those that do not
   seem to find themselves becoming more as a fighter.
     Rangers are not allowed to wear any solid plates of metal upon their
   bodies, although studded and perhaps banded armors would be allowed.
     These men of the land benefit from several different skills and at 
   higher levels gain the use of a limited spell field.


See also: Practice
#
PRACTICE PRACTISE
  Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go
to your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve.  If you type
practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and how good
you already are at these.  You can then use practice <skill>, to
practice the appropriate skill.  You can only practise a certain
amount for each level you gain, and you do not have to save this, it
can be accumulated.  When you go out and begin to use this new skill
you will begin to understand what it is you have just learned. In essence
you will improve you ability to do use this skill.  This will allow
you to become an average user of the skill.  To improve further you must
go back and have someone (guildmaster) teach you the subtlties of the
skill you are using.

The number of practices you recieve is based on the class you are and
the prime ability for that class.  A fighter is strength for example.
This is not the only factor in gaining practices, it is also based on
the NEW things you have done to gain exp.

#

#

ENTER
  If you type 'enter' while you are outdoors, you will enter any
nearby shelter.  You can also follow 'enter' with an argument; for
example, 'enter window'.

#
TIME
  Gives you the current 'gametime'. Your initial reaction to the
output of this command may be one of surprise, but you will get used
to it. you will have to, at any rate, since certain things in the game
depend on this particular notion of time; the opening hours of the
shops, for example.

#

#

'quit'. Note that whatever stuff you might be carrying with you is

until you are able to come back, you will have to find an inn.

See also: INN
#
INN INNS
  Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the

that).

See also: OFFER, RENT
#
OFFER RENT

#
GET TAKE

this world. It is a VERY good idea to check it out once in a while or

idea to sit and rest for awhile; or maybe even take a nap.

#
GRAB
For getting a good grip on something; a torch, for example.

See also: WEAR, WIELD, REMOVE

to do is follow yourself: follow <your name>.

See also: GTELL, GROUP
#
FLEE
  If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little
uncomfortable (maybe you are about to die), just type 'flee', and

the people and objects in there. Unless you are very familiar with the
area in which you travel, however, it is not advisable to use this
command. Frequently, you will find small, but vital hints in the
descriptions of the rooms: An extra peek at your surroundings could
mean the difference between life and death!

See also: COMPACT
#
!
Repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.
#
CONSIDER

Usage : consider <monster>

  This command will compare your Level with the <monsters> level. You
will then receive a rough estimate, which is by no means exact.

Example:
  > consider fido

#
EXPERIENCE XP

Whenever you kill a monster you earn experience points.
When enough experience points are earned, you raise a level after
going to a teacher and typing 'gain'.

A player will earn exp based on the number of classes they have.
ie.  amount = amount/number of classes.  This is true for both multi
and single class characters.  A single class will go up in level faster
as it may seem on the outside, but a multi will actual have the same amount
of exp spread between the number of classes.

When dieing, a player loses exp in accordance to the following chart:

Level			Amount
1-7			1/( 6 * number of classes)
7-14			1/( 5 * number of classes)
15-21			1/( 4 * number of classes)
22-28			1/( 3 * number of classes)
29-49			1/( 2 * number of classes)

As you can see, low levelers lose less exp then a more experienced adventurer.
The key word is experienced, a player that has been around long enough to
obtain a level 29 or above has built sufficient resources to protect themself
and provide a means to avoid death.Low level players do not have this advantage
on their side, this is the reason for the smaller reduction in exp loss when
dieing.

It may seem that multi class characters are losing less exp then a single
class character, but remember, the multi class character has already split
the exp amount between the classes.  Since the amount initial given was
split, and the formulae is above ( amount  = amount / #classes) the amount
lost should also be used in the same fashion to make it fair between multi
and single class characters.  This algorythim has both types of players
basically earning exp and losing exp at the same rate even though the numbers
may not actual be the same when compared.

See Also: GROUP
#
GROUP
Usage : GROUP [player]

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for
killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only
be shared among group members that are in the same location, at the
time of the killing blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group
members have been participating in the fight.

Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are grouped.

To make a group, a leader must be selected. All members of the group
must then follow the leader using the follow command. The leader
should NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group
membership for each player in the group, by using group
<player_name>. The leader should remember to include himself in the
group.

Example:

Cyric and Muth wish to group with Grimwell.

Cyric: follow grimwell
Muth: follow grimwell 
(grimwell should be following no one but himself)
grimwell: group grimwell
grimwell: group cyric
grimwell: group muth

Later when grimwell gets upset at muth (because he is sleeping all the
time) he types : 

> group muth

to kick Muth out of the group.

#
QUAFF POTIONS

Use : quaff <Potion>

Quaff is used to drink a potion.

#
RECITE SCROLL SCROLLS

Use : recite <Scroll> [Target]

Recite is used to read a magical scroll. The "target" can be an object, 
character, or nothing (which generally defaults to yourself).

#
USE WAND STAFF STAFFS WANDS

Use : Use <Staff>
      Use <Wand> <Target>

Using staves will automatically target everybody (or everything) in a
room, in some cases, or everyone not in your group in others.
Therefore staves are naturally very powerful, and yet may be very
dangerous to use around other players.

Using wands require that you point it at a target, which can be either
a character or an object.

Both staves and wands must be HELD in the hand prior to use! (Use the
grab or hold commands). You must still supply the name of the staff or
wand to avoid confusion.

#
ARMOR

   This incantation allows the caster to bring forth a invisible suit of
   magical protection that seems to allow protection even if the caster
   wears other forms of armor or protection.  It is known that a higher
   level mages magical armor will hold its consistancy much longer than
   one of lower level.
   The prayer for this spell seems to work much the same as several priests
   and mages have consulted and tested upon it.

Duration: Level of the Best Magic Class. See Note.
Damage: None
Special: AC is reduced by 2.  Note, this may not be shown by what is on your
	 score. Internally the AC is done by -100 <-> 100, not -10 <-> 10
	 so rounding does occur for the the score command. But it is a good
	 approximation as to your ac.
Note: Since this is a shared spell between mages and clerics, the duration
      is calculated as per the best level of the two. Not necessarily the
      class in which you practiced it first.

#

   The prayer of this spell is commonly known to those priests that follow
   a darker path, but to those that see only the light and truth the true

   path yet they often recieve the full benefits if they are pure.  Others,

   spell evaid their grasp.

#
"CURE SERIOUS"

   This prayer, more intricate than cure light follows the others path

   comes with difficulty and can not recieve the full extent.

Duration: None
Damage: None
Special: A cleric can give upto 2d8+2 points back in health.

#
"CURE LIGHT"

   of heart and follow nothing other than truth and virtue find the prayer
   almost flow with a music from their lips, healing the worst of wounds.
   The prayer, so simple in its words, at times comes hard to those that
   follow a darker path, they recieve the benefits of the spell, yet lack
   the true knowledge to heal a bad wound.

Duration: None
Damage: None
Special: A cleric can give back 1d8 points back in health.  It is has been
	 said that those clerics true to their faith have been able to

#
"CAUSE CRITIC"

   The words of this prayer flow within the priests that are truely dark
   in the heart causing immense pain in those that are the targets of the
   prayer.  Those that follow the path of light often find this intricate
   prayer hard to pronounce, finding the target not suffering the full
   damage of this spell.  It is known a high priest of Aklan has cast this
   prayer upon a follower stealing his life from him on the stop not even
   giving it a second thought.

Duration: None
Damage: 3d8 + 3
Special: None

#
"CAUSE SERIOUS"

   This prayer is the second to be learned by those that follower the
   path of darker realms, for this is often their best attack as those
   that follow the truely vile way find there amount of pain increased as
   the words of the prayer almost flow with a malevolent, stinging song.
   Those of a light path find the words of this spell difficult to say,
   the pain that the spell causes not as much as one would think.

Duration: None
Damage: 2d8 + 2
Special: None

#
"CAUSE LIGHT"

   This spell is the first spell learned by those clerics that chose to
   follow a darker path, for it is with this spell that man Aklan followers
   must cause pain onto others.  Followers have been commonly seen casting
   this spell on someone walking the bazaar, for no reason other than seeing
   the pain in anothers eye.
   Those of a light path find this spell difficult to cast, the words of
   the prayer evading the caster, the spell doing much less damage.

Duration: None
Damage: 1d8
Special: None

#

Damage: None
Special: -1 Hit and -1 save.

#
"DETECT EVIL"

   The incantation of this spell allows one to see a colored outline of
   the targets true faith.  Those who find themselves following a lighter
   path through life find the spell lasting longer, allowing them to see
   more of there eternal foes.  Several high mages have been experimenting
   with this spell trying to get many different colors beyond those which
   the spells calls upon.
   The prayer is very similar to the incantation although the faith of the
   caster is much more dependant upon how long the spell allows you to see
   those of evil.

Duration: 20 hrs
Damage: None
Special: Those of a good alignment have been able to sustain this spell
	 for days on end...

#
"DETECT INVISIBILITY"

   This incantation allows the caster to look into a alternate realm, one
   that lives in a negative vision.  Those that recieve the incantation of
   this spell are allowed to look into the world and see those who dwell
   within, those that walk upon the vision world within the invisibilty
   that the other offers.

Damage: None
Special: Those things equal or less in level are seen by you with the aid of
	 this spell.

#
"DETECT MAGIC"

   has been commented.

Damage: None
Special: None

#
"DETECT POISON"

   to the caster allowing him to locate it for removal.

Special: Can be used on an object or player

#
"ENCHANT WEAPON"

   This incantation is very drawing upon the caster, often forcing him to
   sleep for days, possibly weeks, trying to recover from the loss of 
   power.  For, this spell takes the power from the mage and places it 
   within the item casted upon.  It has been noted, by those that dabble in
   this spell, that higher powered mages seem to be able to place more into
   a item than those of lower levels.

Duration: Permanent
Damage: None
Special: A weapon already altered by a magical means may not be affected by
	 this spell.  The power intoned into the weapon will vary as the
	 castor rises in level, but shall never be worsened.

#
HEAL

   This prayer calls upon the diety to heal all wounds that would ail the
   target of the spell.  This spell is recieved by all that have gained
   the power to cast yet those that are true to virtue find the very 
   difficult prayers of this spell to flow from their lips healing all that
   may ail someone.  Others, especially those that follow a dimmer path
   find the spell heals, yet the true power is just out of their reach.
   The dark of heart can heal yet the true meaning of the spell evades 
   them.  It is known that a high priest of Tyken has healed even the laim
   to full health, allowing them to lead a fullfilled life, having been
   touched by a diety.

Duration: None
Damage: Special
Special: Those with the evil out look on life will do less healing
	 then those seeking a life of virtue and goodness.  The same
	 is mirrored with that of Harm.  A truely holy cleric could
	 take a fighter up to full while others may only heal twice
	 of what their level is.

#
INVISIBILITY

   This incantation allows the target the spell to step into a paralel realm
   that has been reported to be much different than our own.  Although this
   realm has only been seen by one, whom the spell seems to have misfired
   slightly, is claimed to exit, none but the one can varify.  On the
   usual this spell allows the target to slip into a form of non-reality in
   which very few things can see.  You in fact become unseeable to normal
   eyes allowing one to more freely within many hostile realms.  It is
   commonly noted that attacking another while in this state will immediately
   cause one to become visible again.

Duration: 1hr + (level/2)
Damage: None
Special: This is nullified if combat is entered, and a person is rendered
	 visible to those that can see into other plains of existance.

#
APPEAR

   This command willfully dispells a invisibility spell.  Ironhands claim.

#
"LOCATE OBJECT"

   This prayer helps the caster find a object that he knows the exact name
   of.  It must be something close to the caster or well known to him at
   the least, for finding this object somewhere across the realm is a 
   ardous and long task.  Some have noted that this spell cast only once
   has taken days in the process.

Duration: None
Damage: None
Special: None

#
POISON

   A painful spell to those it is cast upon.  This spell is used only by
   priests who worship a disdained diety.

Duration: 6 hrs

#
HARM

   This prayer is one known best by priests who's faith has taken a darker
   path, for they draw the life from their victims and then smite them with
   a single blow.  Those of a more pure path seem to have the words of the
   prayer weak in their tongues, the spell barely affecting the target at
   which they strike.  It has been commonly noted that followers of Aklan,
   especially the high priests have struck even there own followers down,
   truely showing their faith, there hearts cold and black.

Duration: None
Damage: Special
Special: Those with the evil out look on life will do more damage then
	 those seeking a life of virtue and goodness.  The same is mirrored
	 with that of Heal.  A truely vile Aklan follower could take a
	 fighter down to his last 4 hit points while others only do
	 their level worth of damage.

A victim of this spell is allowed a save for no damage done.

#
"ASTRAL WALK"

   This prayer allows the caster to bring forth a door into a trans-dimensional
   realm from which one can go almost anywhere on the known world.  The
   prayer is rather draining and takes some time to cast although those
   who's faith is true to their diety have been noted to bring there followers
   along with them through their door, and out into the new location.  A
   high priest of Tyken had his last day as he prayed for the spell and
   transported himself and a small party to a location known only to him, he
   did not unfortunatly return.

Duration: None
Damage: None
Special: Only rooms that will allow you entrance as per magic can be
	 walked to.
