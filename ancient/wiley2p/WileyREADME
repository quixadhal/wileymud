  Here lies the source code for WileyIIMUD+.  This is not the
  original WileyIIMUD that ran with some fortune awhile back.
  None of the world files are included, as a matter of fact, the
  old Diku format will not even work, you are going to have to
  look at wileydbdocs to figure it out, along with db.c.

  I own none of this, since it is in your hands, you take full responsiblity
  and ownership of it, hack it, smack it , do what you want.....just
  follow the original Diku creators license.doc.

  Thanks go out to ....
    Muth, Harlequin, Grimwell, Derkhil, Yen-Sid, Muidnar, Scourge,
    Scruffy, Goodwind, Corwin, Elcid, Nomad....

    and most of all Daisy, I am sure I have forgotten someone that helped
