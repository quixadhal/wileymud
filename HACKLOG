Installed Debian buster with Gnome desktop
added contrib and non-free to apt sources.list

apt install sudo
apt install dkms build-essential linux-headers-amd64
apt install git git-doc
apt install vim-nox vim-doc

Ugh... stupid nanny state politics...
	To enable root logins from the X11 display manager (gdm)
	edit /etc/gdm3/daemon.conf
	add AllowRoot = true to the [Security] section
	edit /etc/pam.d/gdm-password
	comment out auth required pam_succeed_if.so user != root quiet_success

apt install clang
apt install manpages-posix

Copied .inputrc, .vimrc, .vim/ from my home directory to both wiley and root
Without doing this, cut/paste behavior via Putty was weird.

apt install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libdbd-sqlite3-perl sqlite3-doc
apt install libssl-dev libssl-doc
apt install libpcre3-dev libpcre3-dbg sqlite3-pcre

Chagned /etc/ssh/sshd_config to allow logins without an X11 login already established.
    PubkeyAuthentication yes
    PasswordAuthentication yes
    PermitEmptyPasswords yes
    ChallengeResponseAuthentication yes
    UsePAM yes
    AllowTcpForwarding yes
    X11Forwarding yes
    PermitTTY yes
    PrintMotd no
    TCPKeepAlive yes

OK, this is weird... sshd refused connections for FOUR MINUTES after a reboot?  WTF???
Why would it not start immediately, even before X11 was finished setting itself up?

That's why.  Fucking hell.
