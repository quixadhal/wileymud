Raised from the depths of the ether, to torment the players of WMU once again!

               -= Documentation revised by Quixadhal, 95.12.21 =-

     You have on your screen the latest attempt to document the sprawling mass
of spaghetti which we all know and love... WileyMUD!  DikuMUD are, by nature,
difficult to use, and even harder to program.  They evolved out of a poorly
thought-out design and grew every more convoluted through various people
hacking more and more into them.  Why don't we all just go over to the LpMUD
people and beg them to let us in then?  Well, some of us like taking the mud
down every 10 minutes to fix typos... and some of us like the fact that we
remember the obscure file formats that these beasties use.  Some of us also
have inherited wonderfully designed working muds and haven't yet taken the
time to learn lpc coding sufficiently to attempt a lossless conversion!

     In any case, you must somehow have gotten entangled in this web of
chaos and confusion, so this is an attempt to help you SUFFER! through the
worst of it.  Creating on WileyMUD is fairly easy, but it requires a handy
copy of these docs somewhere nearby to avoid complete madness.  A good
calculator is also helpful since we still do bit-twiddling the old fashion
way... addition.

                          -= RULES and REGULATIONS =-

1)  Your creations MUST fall into the general theme of our mud.
      I define our theme as a "dark medieval fantasy", which means that
    orcs, dragons, evil spirits and spell casters are all par for the
    course.  Machine guns, airplanes, taco stands, and anything else
    from the modern era is unsuitable.  If you want a historical timeframe
    to consider, think about europe before about 800 A.D.

2)  Your work must be of good quality and be error free.
      By good quality, I mean it must be written in the King's English.
    While I won't force people to use British spellings, I also won't mind
    if they do.  Complete sentances are mandatory, and not having english
    as your native language is not an excuse.  I would not think about
    writing areas on a german language mud, as I do not know german and
    would fail miserably.  Probably, if you can't catch the subtleties
    in English poetry, you don't know the language well enough to write
    high quality descriptions.  Remember, the text you enter is the ONLY
    way people can visualize where they are!
      Your work should also adhere to our formatting style.  We generally
    indent room descriptions two spaces on the first line, and let the
    rest be flush with the left margin.  Any other descriptions, such
    as extra details, monsters or whatever, are only indented if they
    exceed a single line of text.  Consider column 75 to be your right
    margin so that word wrapping clients will see things properly.
      Bug-free means you've double and triple checked all those annoying
    little numbers and made sure it looks proper BEFORE giving it to me.

3)  You must submit your work to me for it to be entered into the game.
      Because of the nature of DikuMUDs, you cannot directly enter your
    creations in the game world.  Rather, the entire game must be shutdown
    and reloaded after your changes have been merged into the world files.
    This means that one of the highest immortals must be given your work
    in order for it to enter the game at all.  This also means they get
    a chance to proof-read it before it enters the game.

Table of Contenets:

     This document is broken up into several sections.  Each one corresponds
to one of the five world files, and other sections regarding all the other
files and coding standards.  All WileyMUD files follow a fixed format, so
each subsection will describe the file directly instead of in prose.

   I.  The World File, tinyworld.wld  ...............................   83
  II.  The Mob File, tinyworld.mob  ................................. 1111
 III.  The Object File, tinyworld.obj  .............................. 1111
  IV.  The Zone File, tinyworld.zon  ................................ 1111
   V.  The Shop File, tinyworld.shp  ................................ 1111
  VI.  Miscellaneus Files and their uses  ........................... 1111
 VII.  WileyMUD III source code  .................................... 1111
VIII.  Who has been involved in this mess?  ......................... 1111

I. The world file (tinyworld.wld)

     The world file is the heart of WileyMUD.  It is the largest (over
two megabytes at last count) file involved in the game, and contains well
over 4,000 rooms.  Here is a description of the room structure as it appears
in the file.  Anything enclosed in <symbols> is a piece of data.  Anything
enclosed in {symbols} is a group, which must appear together but which can
appear several times or not at all.  Anything enclosed in [symbols] is a
group which depends on other values, and is only present when those values
are set correctly.  Anything not in these symbols is a literal which must
appear as shown.  All lines begin flush with the left margin and are only
indented for clarity.  If the line ends with a \, it means it is really a
continuation of the previous line but was formatted for readability.

Explanations of Room fields.

<virtual number>:
  A number for the given room. No two rooms may have the same number.
  The <virtual number> must always increase when browsing down the 
  world file (but increments can be larger than one).
  ie.
     #3001
     #3002
     #3010

<room title>~:
  This name is the "title" of the room.  It is very important to have a 
  title to your room as that is the only part of a room that will print
  when 'brief' has been set on a player.  A tilda must follow the name
  of your room.

<description>:
  This is what will print to a character who walks into a room, this should
  include what the room looks like, what the people see and why they see
  it.  There must be a tilda on a line by itself below the last line of
  the description.

<zone number>:
  This is the zone in which the room will reside for purposes of a reset.
  Your room must have a zone or it will have no place in the world to 
  which you build it for.  Before you begin building, you will be given
  a range of virtual numbers to use.  All but the last two digits of
  your range will be your zone number... for example:  if you were told
  to build in the range of 7000 to 7099, your zone will be zone 70.  If
  you were given rooms 16600 to 16699, your zone will be 166.

<room flags>:
  A bitvector consisting of the room conditions.  The ones that are desired
  are added together and that number is used for the final bit.

  DARK           1  Light must be used to see anything.
  DEATH          2  Mortals DIE on entry... NEVER use this one!
  NO_MOB         4  No monsters may enter this room. 
  INDOORS        8  The room is indoors, and unaffected by weather.
  PEACEFUL      16  No fighting can be attempted.
  NO_STEAL      32  No stealing can be attempted. 
  NO_SUM        64  Nothing can be summoned out of this room.
  NO_MAGIC     128  No magic can be cast.
  TUNNEL       256  This room has a possibility of collapse.
  PRIVATE      512  This room cannot be accesed by a teleport spell.
  SOUND       1024  The room eminates sounds.

  SOUND requires addition of two fields below the line containing the
  <zone number>, <room flags>, and <sector type>.

  <sound one>
  ~
  <sound two>
  ~

<sound one> and <sound two>:
  These are text strings which are printed to anyone in the room periodically.
  They may be any length, but should probably be kept to one or two lines.
  Remember to indent if they will be longer than a single line!  Also remember
  to put the ~'s on a line by themselves following the sound line.  You MUST
  have two sounds if you have any.  If you only want one sound, make them
  both identical.

<sector_type>:
  This determines how many movement points are used when moving through
  the room.  This is a bit table, not the amount of movement it actually
  takes to move through this room.  The sector type is also used to decide
  things like lighting conditions, spell success, etc.

  SECT_TELE           -1  Teleports players to another room periodically.
  SECT_INSIDE          0  Indoor room, no weather or lighting changes.
  SECT_CITY            1  City streets, best movement.
  SECT_FIELD           2  Grassy fields.
  SECT_FOREST          3  Dense forest.
  SECT_HILLS           4  Highlands... rocky hills.
  SECT_MOUNTAIN        5  Mountains.
  SECT_WATER_SWIM      6  Shallow water, no current.
  SECT_WATER_NOSWIM    7  Rivers, Requires use of a boat.
  SECT_AIR             8  Requires use of flight.
  SECT_UNDERWATER      9  Deep water, oceans, Requires water breathing.

SECT_TELE:
  The below parameters must be placed behind the <sector_type>.
  <teleport delay> <target room> <look?> <movement type>

<teleport delay>:
  A multiple of 10, the higher the number, the longer the wait before 
  the teleports activates.  (10 is a combat round) 
<target room>:
  The room to which you are teleported to.
<look?>:
  If this value is a non-zero you will automatically look when entering
  the new room.  If it is zero, you will not realize you have been moved!
<movement type>:
  If the teleport does not activate before you move out of the room, this
  is the sector type used for calculating movement costs.

SECT_WATER_NOSWIM:
  The below parameters must be place behind the <sector type>.
  <river delay> <flow direction>

<river delay>:
    The time it takes before you drift through a exit.
<flow direction>:
    The exit through which you will drift.  The exit must exist or no 
    drift will occur.

<exit direction>:
  This combination of a 'D' and exit number.  This field states that a 
  exit will be leaving the room in one of the cardinal directions.

  0 = North
  1 = East
  2 = South
  3 = West
  4 = Up
  5 = Down

<exit description>:
  What a player will see if he looks in the direction of this exit.  There
  must be a tilda on a line by itself after this field.

<exit keyword list>:
  A keyword is what the exit is called if you have to open it.  This is also
  used if you want the <exit description> printed out if they look at a
  keyword.  If the exit is a door, you must have a keyword, without one the
  door cannot be opened or used in any way.

<exit type>:
  This field determines what type of portal the exit is.  If it is anything
  other than '0' there must be a keyword for it to be acted upon.  A door is
  considred opened by the game unless it is closed in the zone file.

    0  A open passage.
    1  A normal door.
    2  A door that cannot be picked, you MUST have the key to unlock it.
    3  A Secret door that is not shown by ovbious exits.
    4  A Secret door that is pickproof.
    5+ A door of the type 4 less, but with an additional alias list.

<key number>:
  The number of the object which can unlock/lock the door.  A value of -1
  means there is no key for this door.

<target room>:
  The virtual number of the room to which the exit leads. If this number is
  -1, the exit doesn't lead anywhere, this is used when you need a exit 
  description but don't need it to go anywhere.  A good example is the edge
  of a forest, where a "look east" command will display the vista to the east
  even though no more rooms yet exist.

  You must have a door between both rooms that the door seperates!

<alias list>:
  This allows you to have a alternate name to a exit.  The northern exit
  could be called a cave instead of north.  This is accomplished by adding
  4 to the exit type that you desire.  ie. 1 + 4 = 5 to include a alias.
  Please note that the alias for the exit must be included in the <keywords>
  for that exit.  Also NOTE that it appears to be disabled in the source.

E: Extra descriptions
   
  Extra descriptions are used for things within the room that you would like
  the player to be able to look at.  This is signified by placing a 'E' on
  a line by itself after all exits have been completed.  Below the 'E' you 
  must add these fields.

 <extra keywords>~:
  A list of the keywords that will allow the extra description to be
  displayed. The keywords must must be seperated by blanks.  This must 
  be followed by a tilda.

 <extra description>:
  The description that is show when a player types 'look at <keyword>'
  and keyword matches one of the above.  There must be a tilda on a line
  by itself following the description.

S: signifies the end of the room entry, and is the diminutive form of $.

II. The mob file (tinyworld.mob)

     If the world file is the heart, the mob file is the limbs of the game.
A world without mobs would be a very boring one indeed, so we provide lots
of painfully entertaining creatures for you to be killed by.  Unlike the
world file, there are three distinct variants of mob records.  The most
common one is the 'MWS' record.  These are the WileyMUD II record types
and they simplified the data entry by sacrificing flexibility.  I do not
believe there are any, but support still exists in the source code for the
type 'D' mobile, which allowed setting of the ability scores, but used a
more archaic format.  I have created a new type 'C' mob entry, which tries
to follow the feeling of the Wiley II mobs, but allows more flexibility and
even future enhancements like variable damage types on multi-attacks such
as the venerable claw/claw/bite.
     To encourage its use, I will begin by describing the type 'C' mob and
then describe the others in how they differ.  Full templates will be given
for each so those ignoring the text and using this as a reference can be
spared some suffering.  Anything enclosed in <symbols> is a piece of data.
Anything enclosed in {symbols} is a group, which must appear together but
which can appear several times or not at all.  Anything enclosed in [symbols]
is a group which depends on other values, and is only present when those
values are set correctly.  Anything not in these symbols is a literal which
must appear as shown.  All lines begin flush with the left margin and are only
indented for clarity.  If the line ends with a \, it means it is really a
continuation of the previous line but was formatted for readability.

-= Explanations:

<#virtual_number>:
  The monsters virtual number.  These work best if in numerical order.
  ie.
   #102
   #201

<name_list>~:
  This are the names by which the mob can be accesed for player actions such
  as 'look at buck'.  In there 'buck' must be one of the names in the 
  <name_list> for the mob to be looked at.

<short_description>~:
  This string will be displayed when the monster takes action.  This is when
  the mob does anything, ie.  A small boy leaves south, A small boy misses you
  with his hit.

<long_description>:
  This string is displayed when the current position of the mob matches that
  of the default position.  If those two do not match the string will simply
  read, A small boy is sitting here.  There must be a tilda on a line by 
  itself following this description.

<description>:
  This string will be displayed when a player looks at the monster.  There
  must be a tilda on a line by itself following this description.

<action_flags>:
  This bitvector define how the monster behave.  The desired bits are to be
  added together and that final bit is to be used as <action_flags>.

  ACT_SPEC          1  This bit should not be set.
  ACT_SENTINEL      2  The mob will not move out of its loading room.
  ACT_SCAVENGER     4  The mob will pick things up.
  ACT_ISNPC         8  Do not use.
  ACT_NICE_THIEF   16  The mob will not attack if a missed steal happens.
  ACT_AGGRESSIVE   32  The mob will attack only things it can see.
  ACT_STAY_ZONE    64  The mob will not move out of its loading zone.
  ACT_WIMPY       128  Mob will flee if injured.  If this bit is combined with
                       ACT_AGGRESSIVE the mob attacks sleeping pc's only.
  ACT_HATED       256  The mob will be attacked by other mobs.
  ACT_ASSASIN     512  Do not use.
  ACT_SCARED_PC  1024  Do not use.
  ACT_IMMORTAL   2048  Mob can not be attacked.
  ACT_HUNTING    4096  Do not use.
  ACT_DEADLY     8192  Do not use. 
  ACT_POLYSELF  16384  Do not use.
  ACT_POLYOTHER 32768  Do not use.
  ACT_GUARDIAN  65536  Do not use.
  ACT_USE_ITEM 131072  The mob will use items that it picks up.
  ACT_FR_MOVES 262144  The mob will use fighter skills.
  ACT_FD_PROV  524288  The mob has a chance to provide food when killed.
  ACT_PROT    1048576  Do not use.
  ACT_MOUNT   2097152  The mob can be ridden.

<affection_flags>:
  This is a bitvector that indicates what the monster is affected by.  The
  bits desired for a mob are added and the final number is that which is 
  used for <affection_flags>.

  AFF_INVISIBLE        2  The mob is invisible.
  AFF_DETECT_INVISIBLE 8  The mob can see_invisible.
  AFF_SENSE_LIFE      32  The mob can sense hidden pc's.
  AFF_SANCTUARY      128  The mob takes half damage.
  AFF_FLYING        2048  The mob can move into FLY sectors.
  AFF_INFRAVISION  32768  The mob can see in the dark.
  AFF_GILLS        65536  The mob can see underwater.
  AFF_SNEAK       524288  The mob will not be seen leaving/entering.
  AFF_HIDE       1048576  The mob will be hidden, even in combat.
  AFF_CHARM      4194304  The mob will act as charmed if a 'follow' command
                          is given to it.

<alignment>:
  This is the monsters alignment read as:
   1000 <> 350   (good alignment)
    349 <>-349   (neutral alignment)
   -350 <>-1000  (evil alignment)


<type>:
  There are four different types of a mobile.  The type defines what the
  mob will do in other respects besides those covered in <affect, action>.

  'D'  - Do not use.
  'S'  - Mob will not have multiple attacks or make sounds.
  'M'  - Mob can have more than one attack.  You must place a number after the
         M to designate how many attacks the mob shall have.  ie.  M 2
  'W'  - Mob can have multiple attacks and make sounds.  Attacks apply to the
         same rule as M mobs.  Sound is handled at the end of the template.

<level>:
  This is the level of the monster, and is used for the 'consider' command
  in game.

<thac0>:
  The amount the mob needs to hit armor class 0.  The lower the number the
  better the chance the mob will hit.  This number should be <level> + 2, with
  a max of 20.

<AC>:
  The mobs armor class.  The lower the number the harder it is to hit the 
  mob.  Figure in dexterity bonuses as dex 18=AC 6, 17=7, 16=8, 15=9, 14+=10.

<hit_points>:
  This defines the number of hitpoints a given monster has.  The format is:
  <level>d8+25.  Figure in constitution bonuses as con 18=+4 per <level>, 
  17=+3/level, 16=+2/level, 15=+1/level.  Constitution bonuses are added to
  the base 25.

<damage>:
  This is the bare_hand damage a mob will give.  The format is: 1d4+0 for any
  normal mobile.  The dice and additional strength damage can be increased
  if the mobile is deserving.

<-1>:
  This is stating that the mob will have a race, which will be place after the
  <experience>.  You do not have to have a race, therefore the -1 is not 
  needed in that case.

<gold>:
  This is how much gold the mob has on its body.  This amount can be stolen
  and is the amount a player will get from the corpse of the mob.

<experience>:
  This is how much exp a player will get for killing the mob.  A general rule
  for experience is 100*<level> + whatever amount you feel neccesary.  Do
  not give out a exuberant amount of exp, but enough to make the fight worth
  a players while.

<race>:
  This is activated by having a -1 in front of the <gold> portion of the mob
  template.  This number will be the race that the mob is seen as when a 
  player looks at it.  Mobs of the same race will help each other out in a 
  fight, keep that in mind.

<E>:
  This option means that there will be a extra description.

<keyword_list>~:
  The words that are used to activate the extra descriptions buffer.

<extra_description>:
  The buffer that will print out if a player looks at one of the keywords.
  There must be a tilda on a line by itself following the description.

Example of a mobile:

-= The zone file description:

Basic template of a zone file:

<#zone_number>
<zone_name>~
<top_room> <reset_time> <reset_mode>
<command> <if_flag> <parm1/command> <max_existing/state> <parm2/room>
S

What this mess means:

<#zone_number>:
  This is the virtual_number of the zone.  The rooms that are part of this
  zone must match the <#zone_number>.  This number relates to objects and
  mobs as well.  The zone will work fastest if all the files that are being
  used inside a zone start with the zone number for their <#virtual_numbers>.

<zone_name>~:
  This is the name of the zone as it would appear in a table of all zones.
  There must be a tilda following the <zone_name>.

<top_room>:
  This is the largest <#virtual_number> of the rooms that are being loaded
  into this zone.

<reset_time>:
  This is the amount of time a zone will remain before it resets all the
  commands within its file.  This value is a number of minutes, usually
  between 30 minutes and a hour.  Zones that never reset have no need for
  a reset time, therefore this value can be placed at 0.

<reset_mode>:
  This field is a command: 0, 1, 2.  Any of those three numbers will tell 
  the zone file how the zone will reset.  They mean:

  0: Don't reset the zone at all. In this case, the age of the zone is never
     updated, and it will never be queued for reset. Thus, the value of the
     <reset_time> is effectively ignored.

  1: Reset the zone as soon as it is deserted, ie as soon as there are no
     players located within the zone.

  2: Reset the zone no matter who or what is in it.

<command> <if_flag> <parm1/command> <max_existing/state> <parm2/room>:
  These are a series of comands that tell the zone file what to do when it
  resets.  Each command has different parts so each will be handled 
  seperately.  The commands are:

  M: This command loads a mobile into a room.
       Format: M <if_flag> <mob_number> <max_existing> <room>

  <if_flag>:
    This is either 0, which means load the mobile no matter what.  Or 1, which
    means load the mobile only if the command before it was executed.  This
    stands true for all the commands in the zone file.  0 means load the
    command, 1 means load this command only if the previous was executed.

  <mob_number>:
    This is the virtual number of the mobile to be loaded.

  <max_existing>:
    This field is the maximum number of mobs that the game will load in. Note
    that if you want more than one mobile in a room you must load each 
    individualy, with the <max_existing> equal to the total number of that
    which will be in the game.  This stands true for all the commands in
    the zone file.  This field must be the total amount that you want to be
    loaded into the game.
    
  <room>:
    This is the virtual number of the room to which the mob is loaded into.
 
  O: This command loads a object into a room.
       Format: O <if_flag> <obj_number> <max_existing> <room>

  <obj_number>:
    This is the virtual number of the object to be loaded.

  <room>:
    This is the room that the obj is to be loaded into.

  G: Give a obj to a mob.  This must be preceeded with the load of a mob.
       Format: G <if_flag> <obj_number> <max_existing>

  <obj_number>:
    This is the virtual number of the obj to be given.

  E: Equips a mob with a object.
       Format: E <if_flag> <obj_number> <max_existing> <equip_position>

  <obj_number>:
    The virtual number of the obj to be equipped.

  <equip_position>:
    This is the position to which the mob will be equiped with the item.  Make
    sure that the obj is able to be equiped in that position, or you will
    have boots loading in as worn on head.  Positions are:

      WEAR_LIGHT    0
      WEAR_FINGER_R 1
      WEAR_FINGER_L 2
      WEAR_NECK_1   3
      WEAR_NECK_2   4
      WEAR_BODY     5
      WEAR_HEAD     6
      WEAR_LEGS     7
      WEAR_FEET     8
      WEAR_HANDS    9
      WEAR_ARMS    10
      WEAR_SHIELD  11
      WEAR_ABOUT   12
      WEAR_WAISTE  13
      WEAR_WRIST_R 14
      WEAR_WRIST_L 15
      WIELD        16
      HOLD         17
      WIELD_TWOH   18

  P: Loads one obj and puts it into another obj.
       Format: P <if_flag> <obj_number1> <max_existing> <obj_number2>

  <obj_number1>:
    This is the obj that will be put into <obj_number2>.

  <obj_number2>:
    This is the obj that will have <obj_number1> put into it.

  D: Sets the state of a door.
       Format: D <if_flag> <room> <exit_number> <state>

  <room>:
    This is the room that holds the door to be manipulated.

  <exit_number>:
    This is the exit number of the exit. (1-5)

  <state>:
    This field puts the door in one of the below states.

	0: Open.
	1: Closed.
	2: Closed and locked.

  R: Removes a obj from a room.
       Format: R <if_flag> <room> <obj_number>

  <room>:
    The room from which the obj is to be removed.

  <obj_number>:
    The virtual number of the obj to be removed.

  L: Led by, makes a mob the leader of others.

       This still needs a bit more work.

  H/F: The hate/fear flags.  These will make a mob hate/fear something else.

       This still needs a bit more work.

What this means:

<#virtual_number>~:
  This is the number of the shop.  This must be followed by a tilda.

<obj1_sold> <obj2_sold> <obj3_sold> <obj4_sold> <obj5_sold>:
  These are objs that the shop will sell and never run out of.  You must give
  the shop keeper the obj in the zone file when loading.  These fields refer
  to the virtual numbers of the objs.  There can only be five items that
  the shop will sell and never run out of.  Other objs can be given to the
  shopkeeper and he will sell just one of them.

<selling_prof>:
  The object value is multiplied by this value when sold. This is a
  floating point value. Must be >= 1.0

<buying_prof>:
  The object value is multiplied by this value when bought. This is a
  floating point value. Must be <= 1.0

<obj1_traded> <obj2_traded> <obj3_traded> <obj4_traded> <obj5_traded>:
  These are the ITEM_TYPE's that the shop will buy.  There can only be five
  different types.

<keeper_message1>~:
  Message when item to buy is non existing.  A %s must be at the beginning
  of this field to signify the shopkeeper will be talking.  The %s applies
  for message fields 1 - 7.  %d symbolizes the coin for the item.

<keeper_message2>~:
  Message when item trying to sell is non existing.

<keeper_message3>~:
  Message when wrong item-type sold.

<keeper_message4>~:
  Message when shop can't afford item.

<keeper_message5>~:
  Message when player can't afford item.

<keeper_message6>~:
  Message when buying an item.  The price is %d.

<keeper_message7>~:
  Message when selling an item.  The price is %d.

<temper1>:
  When player can't afford an item.
    0: The shopkeeper spits player in the face.
    1: The shopkeeper smokes his joint.

<temper2>:
  When player is attempting a to kill a shopkeeper.
    0: Shopkeeper tells player "Don't ever try that again!" and gets the
       first hit!

       killing is impossible.

<keeper_mob_number>:
  Virtual number of the shopkeeper.

<room>:
  The virtual number of the room the mobile must be in for the shop to be
  effective.

<open1>:
  The time which the shop opens.  Use a 0 for this field.

<close1>:
  The time which the shop closes.  If you use 28 for this field, the shop is
  open all the time, never closes.

<open2>:
  Use a 0 for this field.

<close2>:
  Use a 0 for this field.
