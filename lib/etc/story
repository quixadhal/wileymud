     Once upon a time, there was a little mud named Wiley.  He was just
your typical DikuMUD, and a few people got together to play around with
some code.  They hacked the code for some length of time, occasionally
screaming obscenities, or saying things like, \"Huh, huh, huh... This
bubble sort is COOL!\"  Eventually, they opened it to the mud-starved
people of WMU and called it Wiley II.  A poor little Sun 3/60 was found
and managed to keep 30 to 40 people amused with its antics for almost
two years.  At this point, Cyric the Destroyer took the game down for
renovations.  There was much anticipation of Wiley III's return, and it
seemed like we would soon be in for a new experience in mudding!  Alas,
it was not to be.  For Cyric had lost interest in the project and took
his Source with him.  The half-finished Wiley III was released to the
internet via anonymous FTP for a half-hearted month before being buried
forever.

    But wait!  An old packrat hacker who went by the subtle name Dread
Quixadhal, Lord of VI, had snagged a copy and left it buried on his hard
drive for several years.  After playing with several broken LpMUDs and
even a different DikuMUD, he dragged the Wiley III source out and forced
it to learn to like Linux.

    You have here the result of nearly 4 years of ad-hoc development!
