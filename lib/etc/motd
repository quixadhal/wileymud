                 ---=>>> Welcome to WileyMUD III <<<=---

o First of all, I'd like to thank the people from WileyMUD for giving us
  something to ressurect in the first place!  Thanks go to Cyric for
  putting this code out somewhere I could grab it, and thanks go to Muth
  and Muidnar for digging up a copy of the world files.

o Secondly, this code has its distant origins in the standard DikuMUD
  game driver (not ROM, ENVY, or any other derivative).  However, it has
  been hacked to death by Cyric and friends for several years!  There are
  lots of FEATURES, and lots of BUGS!  Help us find both!!!

o HAVE FUN!  This is known as one of the hardest DikuMUD's out there, and
  it can be very frustrating.  All I can say is, hang in there!  Be sure
  to use consider often, and read the info command!

* Be sure to enjoy this mud while it lasts.  The government's acceptance
  of the Federal Communications Decency Act means some big men wearing
  black trenchcoats might come and tell us how to reword all our room
  descriptions at some point in the future.  For details, see the
  the link on my web page <http://yakko/~chris>...

                                          -Dread Quixadhal, Lord of VI.
