'ACT FLAGS' ACT_FLAGS ACT
    Nasty function that does formatted output for player situations.

        $n - ch                      $N - victim
        $m - him/her/it of ch        $M him/her/it of victim

#
ADVANCE
    To advance a player to a level higher than his present. Default is to
    advance him one level. A level 0 player (Man/Woman) is always only
    advanced by one level.

    I think negative arguments will demote players as well!
#
AT
    Used to execute a command at the location specified.  Typically,
    this will be the name of a mob or player.

    "at eli trans bozo" -- teleports bozo to eli
#
ATTRIBUTES
    Currently these are the only attributes you may work with when working
    with cust. Things in <> are what you are to enter, <CR> means hit
    return at this point.

    cust desc           <CR>
    cust extra          <keywords> <CR>

    cust tele           <time> <to_room> <look-flag> <CR>
#
CUST
    Cust will allow you to customize certain aspects of a room that you
    are currently 'standing' in. Below is a list of available fields that
    you may use when customizing.

    cust <field> <attribute>

    field:
        name : This is the name of the room you are in.
        desc : This is the rooms main description.
        extra: This is the rooms extra description.
        exit : This works with one of the FIVE exits available.
               You may add an exit, delete an exit or change
               certain properties of an exit.
        xdesc: This works on a exits description.
        flags: This works on the room flags. 'help room_flags'

    like pain and want to fill the disk quickly!
#
EVENT
    This command allows an immortal to cause a pre-coded event
    to happen, usually in the zone they are standing in.  These
    special events help add a bit of variety to the normal mud
    environment.
#
FORCE
    Command used to force all following arguments to be passed to
    another players' command interpreter as if they had typed it.
    Useful for helping players find things.  Commonly used for
    annoying the players.

    The format is: load <type> <vnum>

    Where <type> is either 'obj' or 'char', and vnum is the vnum of the
    object or NPC character you wish to create.  Objects will appear in
    your inventory, while NPCs will appear in the room you are standing
    in.
#
LOGS
    Toggles reception of log statements as a notify channel.  If on,
    you get debug info sent to your character.  If off, they only go
    to the logfile.
#
NOHASSLE
    Makes you invisible to all other players.  Also makes you
    impossible to attack or affect.  This can be set on mobs.

#
PSET
    Allows a Wiz to set values pertaining to the type of object being
    worked on.

    Usage: pset <att> name <val>

    att list: align class exp lev sex race hit mhit tohit bank gold prac
    name: is the person|object|mobile you are working on.
    value: an integer corresponding to the value you wish to set.

    align       1000.....-1000
    class       DO not use this one, let them suffer with what they chose
    exp         any integer value, perferably higher then the value they
                have
    lev         use advance instead! This screws multiclass
    sex         If they really want it?
    hit         integer: Hit points
    mhit        Max hit points, you should not set this, unfair.
    tohit       changes the thaco
    bank        if they need reimburse for money, use this instead of
                giving.
    gold        take it away if need be.
    prac        Do not let them advance unnatuarly
#
PURGE
    Destroys ALL objects and mobs in the room you are standing in!
    Useful after you've had your fun with the Berserker Axe.

        purge <object>      Figure this one out yourself.
#
RENTMODE
    Allows you to set the rent value multiplier.  If all the rent
    values are set properly, this should be 1.0.  You can have
    specials by using fractions, or turn rent off with 0.0 (but
    you still have to rent to not lose your items!).

#
SETREBOOT
    Sets the time of day at which the gamedriver will automatically
    reboot.  You can set two times, or set both to the same time to
    only have one reboot per day.
#
SHOW
    This is how you find what mobs match a pattern, such as
    "show guard", which produces a LOT of output.
#
SHUTDOW
    A placeholder to prevent you from accidentally shutting down
    the game.  Since this comes first in sorting, you must type
    out the entire SHUTDOWN command for it to work.
#
SHUTDOWN
    Shut the game driver down and signal the boot script to exit.
    Only do this if you are doing maintenance on the machine the
    game runs on, or if you made a horrible data-corrupting bug that
    will break things if allowed to continue.
#
SLAY
    Kills a mortal, lower level wizard, or mob.  No questions asked.
#
SNOOP
    Hooks your display onto a player so you see everything they see.
#
SNOWBALL
    A cute attack that only immortals get to use!
#
SPELLS
    Show all spells in the game.
#
STAT
    Shows some internal data about game objects, beyond what the normal
    player interfaces should reveal.

    Usage: stat < pc|mob|obj|room > [ name|vnum ]
#
STEALTH
    Sets the stealth flag on a player.
#
STRING
    For changing the text-strings associated with objects and characters.
    The format is:

    string <type> <name> <field> [<string> | <keyword>]

    Type is either 'obj' or 'char'.
    Field is one of the following(the names may be abbreviated):
    Name                    the call-name of an obj/char - kill giant
    Short                   for inventory lists (objs) and actions (chars)
    Long                    for when obj/character is seen in room
    Title                   for players
    Description             For look at. For objs, must be followed by a
                            keyword
    Delete-description      only for objs. Must be followed by keyword

    Where a string is expected as the last argument, a newline will make
    you enter a string mode, and the game will prompt you for new lines to
    the string until you exceed the maximum length for the string or you
    end a line with a '@'.
#
SWITCH
    Take control of a mob as if it were your character.  This is
    the bread and butter of role playing, as it lets you take the
    form of any mob, suspending the AI while you have control of
    it.
#
TICKS
    Displays when the next "tick" of various types will occur.
#
TRANSFER
    This yanks a given mob or player to your location.  Very handy
    for helping players around unintended jams, also handy when
    used with AT.
#
USERS
    A who list that shows where players are logged in from.
#
WALL
    Global emote that has no prefixes.  This can be used for
    atmosphere, or for warnings.
#
WIZLOCK
    Prevent mortals from logging in.  This should be used if you
    are debugging.
#
WORLD
    Some statistics about the game world.
#
ZPURGE
    Same as purge, but to an entire zone.  Handy if you want to
    reset a zone to boot-time state, do this, then do reset.
