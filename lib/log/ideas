**Laurie: like instead of A Doppleganger is standing here, say Laurie is standing here.  Or Suzy is standing here.

**Thrym: 100*<spell level> when you gain in skill on a successful cast
**Thrym: or also 100*<player level> for thief skills etc...
**Ender: - for the young lasses in Highstaff - if you respond to them by hugging or kissing them, they will start following you much like the villagers in shylar.

**Lan: maybe a Ranger skill could be awareness? You could sense mobs coming when they were in the square next to you
**Lan: Not the specific type, just that  somehting is moving to the west, etc.
**Lan: maybe when you  die, you won't need to have more exp to gain then you would if you just gained a level
**Lan: It seems to me that I am always running into people who have just cleaned out an area. Perhaps it would be possible to make a few more areas for levels 4
**Lan: 4-12? I am ususally helping lower levels, so its tough to get them exp when everything is dead...
**Jack: Maybe rangers should be allowed to have a modifyer to the terrain they are in. It seems silly that they should 
**Jack: have a hard time walking in grass or light woods. they are rangers after all! :)
**Jack: I like the fact that there is not alot of high power crap in the game. This mud is so much better than anything else I
**Jack: have played. It is much more realistic. Unfortunatly i am seeing it turn into an item mud. I hope this won't be the case.
**Louis: make the 'wear all' command include wielding a weapn :)
**Jack: Elros Tror. Levels 4-10. Come talk to me about it anytime :)

**Quixadhal: zombie bit for returning beasties

**Dorn: Puck and I were thinkin that it's a little unfair that a 7/7 char get's almost 2x the experience of a 8th level char, in a group situation... I fell as t
**Dorn: (cont) I feel as though the head of the group should be able to deside how much exp goes to each of the members...
**Dorn: I wish I could name objects... like my weapons and such
**Dorn: more emotions: grimice confusion 
**Dorn: the banks should give loans at like 11 percent
**Dorn: the banks should give account interest at like 4.5 percent
**Dorn: exp should be divided by damage done.... sorta
**Quixadhal: hack exits command to auto-show vnums to imms.
**Myrth: a high level spell for finding the +/+ of a weapon
**Slyde: how about a title command to change our title?
**Slyde: how about a donation room?
**Slyde: how about a stable?
**Slyde: when an exp goes negative let it stop at next level, but keep the other classes going...

**Grimwell: Grimwell: dally@empirenet.com
**Grimwell: current residence in California
**Grimwell: so don't invite me to a tea party eh?
**Storm: not sure if it exists, but how about a silence spell or silence 10' radius like in d&d? so its effective against mobs.
**Storm: how about making it so if your charmies are sleeping, none of the charm time expires...or perhaps it can actually regenerate...
**Storm: perhaps the time that wears off during a charmies use can be replenished with an additional casting of the same spell, with a saving throw of course...
**Edge: how about making more items with +hit+dam bonuses...and if there are, make so we can find out...perhaps thru apraise...
**Storm: how about a higher level equivalent of shield, which would protect from higher level spells, like from lightning bolt or flamestrike or even fireball(ie minor globe of invunerability)
**Storm: how about a Darkness spell, impervious to light sources or infravision...
**Edge: perhaps a barkskin spell and entangle spell for rangers? U could decide what it should be for. Comes from D&D spells.
**Storm: how bout a group invis spell?>
**Storm: how about if weather dependent spells were higher damage than if there were no rain or lightning going on
**Storm: as far as the weather thing goes,maybe a d10 for lightning or snow on call lightning or even lightning bolt improve the damage, maybe even a bonus could be made for ice storm or cone of cold because of harsh weather?
**Edge: How about making thieves get exp for stealing from nonplayer,nonsleeping mobs at a certain levl.Perhaps the Exp could be the worth of the object times the ratio of the thiefs level to the mobs level but not to exceed the worth of the object.
**Edge: how about a climbing skill for thief types that gives them a chance of reduced moves in hill or mountainous area
**Edge: how about a stalk command where u can hide, and follow and the person doesnt see u following or start following
**Quixadhal: Dead Souls has lots of single player chatroom on I3.
