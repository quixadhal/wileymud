TO THE GODS!~
Yesterday, I was on and the system hit some major lag or
something because I    was sitting around for ten minutes and I
got no response, so I was forced to  terminate my link.  I had a
copper breastplate, a helm, a longblade, food, and  some padded
leggings and sleeves.  Could I please get some of that stuff
back?

About AC again...~
Well, my AC drops 2 steps....Ok that implies that my EQ isnt what
it used to due to all the fights I've been in and so on....Then
there is the blacksmith..  He says that all of my EQ is OK....

So..here is an idea..make damaged EQ LOOK damaged and furthermore
make the Blacksmith a little more reliable.....i e make him
work...

And a small favour for poor, death-pursued me....make the
recall-branch bit less expensive   :)

Thanks for your time!

RE: weapons~
Most of the weapons you were using for backstabbing shouldn't
have been used in the first place.  The longest sword you should
be able to use is a shortsword.  If there are items that are
being used that seem to be longer than that please let me know as
they are bugs.
Shortsword
Dagger
Any other short weapons.
The above should be the only weapons available.

If your message for wielding says 'You are forbidden to do that!'
then you cannot wield it do to your class.  Ie.  You are a cleric
trying to wield a weapon that has been enchanted only for mages
to use.

This will allow you to choose if you wish to have either of the

only for PC -> PC.  A mob can still cast either of these on you
though.

You should not be able to kill another player UNLESS you and
he/she are both registerd for player killing. If this is wrong,
please let me know. I am going to great lengths to make this

Comments~
Why is it that when something as good as Wiley exists that it
seems to receive more complaints than compliments?  Well, I for
one would like to use this space to compliment Cyric and crew for
the wonderful work they have done on Wiley.  Over the past year
or two they have been extremely open to player comments and have
implemented many player friendly options.  These include:  free
rent, loss of exp. base on level and number of classes when you
die (a sliding scale), user friendly commands too numerous to
name, and a host of other nice features.  They have strived to
keep Wiley both challenging and playable, and to pump out new
areas as quickly as their free time will permit.  I think we owe
it to these dedicated individuals to give them a little praise
now and then to help temper the number of grumbles and gripes
they receive.

Good work guys!

I'd like to apologize for my personal comments on me
reimbursement which Harlequin remarked upon.  It was not my
intention to sound demanding or derogitory (although it may have
come out to do a frustration born of problems which I created for
myself).  I will en- deavor in the futu to phrase my problems or
inquiries in a less derogitory manner.

First let me say that this is~
First let me say that this is the best mud I have been on.  I
have had a greaat time.  The only problem I have had is losing
all my equipment when the game crashes.  Right now I am a 4/3
Fighter/Mage.  Powerfl enough that noone has pi crashes.  Leaving
me to powerful to evoke pity and to week to reequip my- self.  My
only other problem is finding things.  When a more expierenced
playeris leading me somewhere they go to fast for me to learn the
path.  Thus I suggest selling maps to other locales:ie from
village to goblins or village to Highstaff.  One final suggestion
keep villagers out of the bulletin room, and and make it noise
proof.

Items/Magical~
I am glad to hear that the stronger items are more difficult to
get, that is the why we invisioned it to be.  On the issue of
items losing power and/or becoming junk
How many suits of dragon scale armor do you think one can make
from the hide of a dragon.  Surely your answer is a hell of a
lot!  Yes, indeed you could make a hell of a lot, and indeed
there are now a hell of a lot in the game.  My response to this
was to make more in different places, on different mobs.  
Have fun finding the new stuff!  8)

Scruffy~
To the creators of Greth and Highstaff.~
Hi all!
   First ... for greth could you please check into the experience
given for slavers.  It seems disproportionate compared to the
amount of damage they do.
  Second... Can we tone down a few guards in highstaff?  One of
the reasons that you dont see more people staying there is that
if you kill a youngster so she wont grow up into some goody goody
and a guard comes by you get your backside smoked.  This chance
is highly likely since the proportion of guards to people seems
to be about 1 in 5.  I would make my home in Highstaff, but since
I am usually running away from a Captain or Proud Guard I've
tic'ed off it just isnt worth it.  Midguurd has the right idea
since the guards are fixed and the only other aggressives
(starved men) are not large mobs.
 
  Other questions... Is it possible for shops to be able to keep
their inventory over reboots?  If I sell a set of steel banded
bracers to the armourer and later get my current pair scrapped it
would be nice to be able to go back and by a pair that I had
sold, but the inventory on every shop resets at reboot.
  Also can you set a ceiling (other than available cash) for
items that shops will buy.  Someone comes in and sells a big item
in the shops at shylar and poof he has no more cash for smaller
items.
 
  Next... I've been through the jungles mapping and my first
impression is that they need a few more mobs.  Population density
seems a bit low.  Also, is there any announced date for the
opening of the city in the jungle? (the walled one).
 
  My great Thx as always.

-= Will look into Gredth.

   the ratio is but you must remember, the reason the city is so
   safe is because of the large number of guards.

   of yet he hasn't given me a finish date.  Sorry.

Hard but not fair?~
Well this thing is bugging me a little first,I like this mud more
than others.
But better armor is only availible to higher levels like over 20
since people can charm Eli or stuff like that.I think that there
should be some way for level 8-13 to get some safe exp....because
its just between those levels that peopl e stop playing their
characters because they die too much.
Again i would like to say that this is a great mud but a little
too hard.  So i would please get some better availible eq for
lower levels?

Hermits . . . rehashed~
I am here to beg mercy from the gods.  Remember the day when
the goblins invaded shylar and you guys left a prize?  I was the
one who got the halberd.  I made it invisible so that If I got
disarmed I would be able to get it back, but today I lost it to a
hermit who could apparently see invisible.  Can they all???  I
know the hermits are staying, and we've been through this subject
before.  People say, 'Well, don't go to a screen with a hermit
and start attacking.' It is kind of hard when an Aklan Guard just
attacks you.
  Please let me know if I can get my halberd back or if these
were your intensions for having hermits in the first place.

On Quests... From Uncle Scruffy~
Hi
   This is the information that I've gleaned on quests...  First
of all there appear to be two types.  The first one seems to
usually occur when a couple of the creators (gods, wizards) get
online and start giving out mysterious poems or clues to an
objective which you must find.  Usually there is a deterrent to
you getting to this objective in the form of a monster standing
there waiting to eat your face.  The rewards for success are
great for the gods are generous.  Weapons and armor of great
power and large (obscenely large for lower levels) amounts of
experience are the reward for success.
  The second form of quests I must admit I have only heard in
rumor and that takes the form of clues which are hidden in
mysterious locations which lead you to further clues and so forth
until a goal is reached.
  I have no experience as to what the rewards to be for the
second, but I have been lucky enough to be one (and there are
more) of the winners of the first.
  My advice is as follows, keep your eyes and ears open!  The
gods on this world are mysterious and devious and quests can turn
up in voices from nowhere, mystic notes, and billboards on
travellers road for all I know.
   Scruffy.

Spell Durations changed?~
Seems to me that the past two days my spells have had a LOT
shorter duration.  Shield, Fly, Armor, Bless, and especially
Strength are going away after 2 tics or so.  It was my
understanding that spells for multi-classes had returned to full
strength and duration. 
  Is the a wrong assumption, a bug, or something new?
   Scruffy.

Uhmmm Muth? About Highstaff.~
Uhmmm well gee, You see its like this.  If the city is safe with
all the guards, it's also safe from us.  And while I really do
enjoy walking around the city and seeing all the great mobiles it
would be nice to be able to kill a few.  :)

It is with sad misfortune that I write this. My brother, Lan,

when he fought the slavers of Gredth. He had vowed to destroy
evil, no matter what the cost would be. I have pledged to carry
on his mission, to make shylar and all of the surronding realms
safe for its people. I ask you to join me in this mission, to
make the lands safe for it citizens. 
Please honor my brother by joining me to reclaim this fair land.

Comments~
1. Charm monster still allows people to charm other registered
AND non- registered characters.  Muidnar already knows about the
problem.
2. Aliya,  I take offense at your statement that I'm trying to
kiss up to the wiz's on Wiley.  After hearing several of the gods
talking about all the negative comments being thrown at them, I
thought it might be nice to pay them a compliment or two.  I am
usually one of the bigger complainers..er..critical observers
myself. :)
3. I wholeheartedly agree with Drizzt about having the your spell
(prac- tice) lists accessable when sleeping.  I see no reason
that a character who uses spells so frequently would not have a
few dreams about them.  :)

A friend suggested that he would like to see werewolves and a
weredargon with a human form and a human size dragon form.  He
also was wondering about being able to bet on the games in the
arena in highstaff.
I was wondering if there was a place where you could dock boats
temporaryly if you buy one and If we would see horses and/or
chairiots.  
thats it fer now....the forest and horses/chairiots are my main

did not need to rent.  I have no idea why i lost my equipment.
So i had to quit ..... so i screamed to ask if anyone could help

extra equipment in gredth so i preceded to goto gredth to pick up
some free extra equip and i got killed by a stupid starved

AAAARRRRGGGGHH!!!!!  It has been a frustrating evening!!!!
I just ask that i could get reimbursed sometime .... 
I am will am on usaully  around 11pm till 12pm....
I think it is hard to get to and from highstaff if you are not a

IMPORTANT :GODS PLEASE READ!~
Sorry about above...so anyway
I was on killing ants with two other people. One got killed and
ended up back at the inn. We came to pick him up and an invisible
someone was trying to get him to register. I said in general
never register. One of the guys I was with told the people to
bugg off...because there were more than one trying to get him to
register.
Well someone called him a jerk and I got upset and said "Bite me
you jerk!"
Well Highlander thought that I was saying it to him when I was
really talking to the invis who was trying to get an innocent to
register!
That is how I got registered!
So anyway...he teleported me to somewhewre I never had even heard
of before and I had to beg one guy to summon me to
Highstaff...and another I had to pay a whole lot to summon me to
the inn...next to eli!
I don't think registration should be so easey to do for one and
two I think I am owed an apology from Highlander because he did
that and I didn't even do anything to him...I wasn't even talking
to him to begin with!
That just REALLY PISSES ME OFF!
Aliya the really disgrunteled
P.S. I also think you should be able to unregister once incase
you got tricked into it!

along.  I have experience with the online editing commands and
the role of immortality.  It would be an honor to be an immort on
this mud.  I have seen a few muds go down the drain because new
areas were not being added in.  I would also like to help design
some of the other classes in the AD&D players handbook.
Paladins, Druids and Bards would be a great addition to the game.
Feel free to summon me at anytime.  I will tell you more of my

Succubus~
YOU BETTER READ THIS!~
This MEANS YOU!  First I wanted to say what a fine Job is being
done here.  It encourages lots of people to spend lots of time
playing games.  GAME is the key word here.  I think that some
things here should be taken a little less seriously.  Some
problem could be ridden of if players would save.  I've played
several diffent classes and characters on this mud, experiencing
the best of everything.  I've caused my share of trouble, and
I've had more than my share of fun.  But what I was saying is
that I have NEVER EVER EVER lost anything in rent or because of a
game crash.  I've died SAVED and a crash occured.  I had all my
stuff.  I've accidentally quit right before a crash.  Miraculusly
gotten my stuff back, SAVED, then crash...I still had all my
stuff.  As for Daisy, how could anyone and I do mean ANYONE, how
could anyone harbor any ill fealings towards such a wonderful
woman?  And I think it has been sufficiently brought up that
registering is a dangerous thing to do.  AND that it can't be
reversed.  AND that even then Cyric and Co. have installed
NOSUMMON and NOTELEPORT so People like Highlander can't teleport
you to a nasty place.  By the way, Nice try on me Highlander.
Well, you all take care, and don't let the Demoness get you in
the night.

Agree with Succubus~
I agree wholeheartedly with Succubus.  I've also played several
characters and spent more than my share of time on this mud, and
I've never had a problem with losing equipment.  Save is an
important command, and it does work.  The gods have been more
than generous in installing safeguards to the game like no-
summon and registering; at some point characters have to start
taking responsibility for themselves (*grin*).  Thanks for a
great mudding experience!

Harlequin~
My two cents....~
And since I've got some weight around here, it's gonna be a BIG
two cents....*snicker*...
SAVE SAVE SAVE SAVE SAVE.  Succubus is right, the only way you
can lose your stuff around here is if you either A.) Don't save
at all, or B.) you die and don't get a chance to save, i.e. the
game crashes as you die.  So save save save.  Get tintin and set
up a macro to suto automatically save you at various points.  It
really helps.

Palas: (and anyone else for that matter)  Just because you don't
see us on the who list, doesn't mean we are not on.  If someone
is bugging you that way, just give a shout and we'll help you
out.  Of course, just seeing a name like LouSucksPalasDick or
something is grounds enough for us to kick the person off the
game....
REGISTERING: Yes, we have warned time and time again that to

RE: Advancement~
You have to find your guild.  If you're below 6th level, it will
be somewhere in or near Shylar (rangers get to track down their
wandering guildmaster in the grasslands).  If you're ready to go
to 6th level, you get to make the trek to Highstaff.  Follow the
road east out of town and take the first fork south.  Be careful!
There be GIANTS in the mountains!

new places~
Well, I discovered the ogre's lair not too long ago... 
High-levelers only, I suggest, cuz I did die there.

Then I just discovered a cemetary in the redspines... I might
be able to find it again if anybody is interested.

There's keeps everywhere... I think the key's should be strewn 
about the map so we can go in and use them as our own.

And there should definately be rules set for what a keep costs,
cuz Dorn needs one and can probably afford it. 

Oh, and until there's a reset, avoid Gredth.  Just trust me.

Oh, and quixadhal, Cynxena wants to experience the Axe.

Hiya Grimwell!  Long time no see!  New areas eh?  Well, nothing
finished but there's a couple half-finished.  You've probably
noticed lots of the changed commands/way-of-things (IE: darkness
outdoors).

I tried to update the "info" command a bit... that might be helpful.

RE:Scourge~
Yup, afraid Scourge really does have that good of stats.  He's
always had good stats since the days of Wiley I, which was before
*I* had ever seen it (I came into Wiley II).  Since he's had to
restart his character (which had progressed to level 50) at least
twice now, I don't see granting him his original stats as
anything unusual.  By right, he should also have a keep and be
50th level too.

I would hope that you might expect a similar respect when whoever
takes over this place erects Wiley IX and you log into it as a
newbie.  I'd also hope the other players respected and feared you
as one of the Ancients who Knows.

NEW BUGS... er.. features!~
Just to warn everyone... I did some recoding of things this
morning.  Experience is now handled differently for groups.... if
you are not grouped, or grouped only with yourself... you should
get full exp for mobs (plus a 10% bonus for registered servents
of Quixadhal!).  Groups of 2 or more will find the ratios changed
a bit... I tried to make it fair to both multi-classers and
singles and NOT to lose too much exp in the division.  Let me
know how that works out.

ALSO:  You can now use "me" or "myself" to refer to yourself in
many commands.  And a few may have noticed that kill now comes
BEFORE kiss <grin>...  Hope you all have fun!

This is important people!

You must now bury your dead!  If you do, you'll get a pleasant
little exp bonus and become a little nicer.  If you don't...
Well, you'll find out soon enough.  Let's say it won't be pretty.

guilds..~
oh... i found them alright... but i couldn't figure out how to

need better help files on skills...

and

does your mastery of your skills increase each time you use it?
~

gain~
Apparently, it is not.  I'll ask Quixadhal to add the gain
command to the help command list.  Also, the command ALLCOMMANDS
will give a list of all available commands available to players.  

And, yes, your skill does increase to a certain level by use of
the skill.  Each time you cast a spell, use a fighting or
stealing skill or use a weapon of a particular class, that skill
gets better up to what is known as fair, I believe.  TO improve
the skill knowledge to master, you must practice it once or twice
after you get it to fair.

about 3 people who even come around here anymore in the first
place. 

This game used to be fun, I thought about finding a new mud.. but
simply decided to stay on this one because the interaction was
normaly good.. but oh well, I guess my friends and I simply find
a new mud, no problem.
