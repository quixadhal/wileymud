Haven~
  Pillars of flawless white marble flow the height of this chamber laced with
a sparkling silver and golden outlines.  The ceiling, high above, combines
into a blackened dome, past which lie the stars and dreams of men.  The floor
that you trod upon seethes with etching as you can follow the lives of men
through etchings of things that were, are, and shall be.
  To the north a tremendous archway leads into a antechamber beyond from which
harmonious music flows.  Opposite, a pair of oaken doors span possibly fifty
feet high towards the impending ceiling.  To the east a hall leads from the
base of Haven.  A disturbing spiral staircase of blackest marble ascends
through the dome, high above.

thing is, you can't tell if you are on the inside or outside of a huge sphere.
  A bonfire of insane proportions burns in the distance, and you suddenly

of hot and cold are almost too much for you to bear.
  You can now make out a figure standing near the fire.  It seems to be

upwards, and join the myriad of stars overhead.  Sometimes the fire shifts

the body smolders, its eyes suddenly open and a soundless scream emerges
from its mouth!  The fire swiftly darkens to a murky red colour, and you see
a glowing ball of red light launch upwards to the stars.
  The pile of bodies that sits behind the fire is too large to comprehend.
It is composed of every imaginable creature, and many that you've never seen
before.  Strangely, there seems to be no ash, no remains from the fire.

his throne sits empty.

who seek to devour them.  The light from above dances on the floor of the
pool, creating hypnotic patterns of chaos and order, clashing and meshing
together.  In the center of the bottom of the pool, you see a massive cauldron
which glows with an eerie light.  The light is not bright, but it hurts your
eyes nevertheless.  As you catch a glimpse of it's contents you turn away,

A Snow-Covered Hillside~
  The hillside climbs steeply here.  A thick blanket of snow covers the
tall grass and sagebrush that cling to life beside the fire.  The ruddy
light makes the snow seem bloody somehow, as if something deadly dark
hunted this land.  For some reason, it doesn't really feel cold at
all.
  A truely monstrous spruce tree dominates the hilltop.  You think
that only the strongest of eagles could make their way to the top, any
lesser birds would be damaged by the winds.

A broken branch~
  You are precariusly standing on a large branch, high
atop an enormous spruce tree.  The wind howls gleefully and you
feel your footing shift uneasily yet again.  There is a ragged
hole near the trunk, with a few scraps of twigs and perhaps a
few bones sticking out.  It may have once been a nest.
  The limp light of the setting sun slides in from the west,
but does little to dispel the chill that hangs in the air here.

flows there. Its current alone is causing the side of the bank to crumble under
its power.  Despite the roar it remains rather peaceful under the protection
of the shaded trees.

Darkened wood~
  The canopy of these trees have grown so close that they cut off almost all
the light.  There exists only enough to see by.  The moss growth here is
immense as much of the rains have been trapped under this dense canopy creating
a perfect environment for certain growth.
  The wood lies all about.

Darkened wood~
  The canopy of this wood keeps out most of the light leaving hardly any to
even see by.  Luckily there is enough to see the sheer cliff that lies to
the southeast.  Elsewhere, on all the trees, colored moss grows rapidly.
  The wood lies all about.

Wood~
  The small trees keep out most of the direct sunlight, but some flows through
in spots.  A large stream travels through this section of the wood falling
abruptly as it passes over a cliff and falls.  Looking to the east you can see
that the trees thin slightly as they begin to climb several hills.
  Some grassy hills lie to the east while this wood is in all others, except
south where the stream falls over a cliff.

stream~
  The stream is not at all large but the flow is rather quick. You could cross
it without difficulty.  The waterfall it tumbles over must be hundreds of
feet down as you can hear a roar from the bottom as it ends in a canyon down
below.

  Light echoes forth through some trees to the west as there must be a path
of sorts somewhere in that direction.  Trying to squint to the south you
think you might be able to make out a small path within the darkness of the
wood.
  Paths lie to the west and south while the wood lies elsewhere.

  The darkness of this wood is lifted for a second as the trees end several
feet away from the edge of a very steep cliff.  Looking down you can see that
whatever does lie hundreds of feet below is enshrouded in a mist of its own.
This cliff edges the wood as the canyon continues to travel northeast and
southwest.
  The wood lies in every direction but east where a cliff ends your travel.

  Small rocks and more pebbles are apparent as the road begins to ascend and
descend over hills that seem to grow larger as this road continues east.  The
grassland that spans out around you seems to grow shorter to the east as
it covers the hills that you can see in the distance.
  This road continues east and west while grassland lies elsewhere.

Travelers road~
  Travel along the road becomes a little more strenuous as it begins to travel
up and down continuous hills that grow larger with each passing hill.  Some
short grass grows upon the hills, just enough to cover the rocky soil
underneath.

  The hills here grow larger to the east and slightly smaller to the west,
where squinting there might be some grasslands miles away.  Vision to the
east is almost impossible as you can't see over the next hill, and then the
one following, a never ending cycle.
  This road weaves through the hills to the east and west while rocky hills
lie to the north and south.

  The hills here are very tall and rocky making the road weave in and out
allowing travel slightly easier than walking on the hills themselves.
Reaching the top of a hill to the east you can now see a enormous mountain
range that rises up, enshrouded in mist, miles to th east.
  This road makes its way through the hills east and west while the hills

  The land rolls slightly here as the tall grass that you can see spanning to
the west is twice as high and thick as the small tufts that exist here.
Large rock outcroppings are becoming more apparent to the east as the hills
get larger and larger.
  A huge expanse of grassland lies to the west while hills lie elsewhere,
gaining height to the east.

  To the north and west you can see a wood that follows around for off in
the distance.  Directly to the south the hills appear to grow larger then
cutting off abruptly over a huge cliff, which over the edge lies a valley
enshrouded in mist hundreds of feet below.
  A wood lies to the north and west far off in the distance while these hills
seem to continue to the east.

a wood of sorts.  Elsewhere to the east and west these hills continue and to
the south they seem to grow in height and become more rocky.

  Small clumps of grass grow about you whereas to the north you can see that
more grass seem to grow on the small hills.  Looking to the south you can
hardly see over the next hill as they appear to become even more rocky with
rarely any plant growth.
  Hills lie all about you.

  Reaching the top of a huge hill you can now see far to the east the outline
of a enormous mountain range that stretches to the north and south as far as
you can see.  The rocks here on these hills are almost all boulders which
makes travel very difficult while to the west the hills don't seem to be as
dangerous.
  Hills lies all about you except to the north where grasslands continue.

  As this small path climbs higher into the mountain, where the cliff used to
fall to the east, now stands more red rock that shoots high into the sky.
Passing by you can see that this part of th trail is much more traveled
especially around one small area that seems to hold a gate embedded within
the rock wall that stands some fifty feet high.  Had you not looked closer
this would have only seemed like part of the mountain itself.

  Looking to the east you can see that the mountain finally begins it ascent
into the sky.  As you follow it up, the red rock and crags that make up the
mountain look very difficult to manage, and very dangerous.  The foothills
of the mountain lie all about you but do not even compare to the stunning red
rock of the redspine.
  The mountain rises to the east while hills lie elsewhere.

Redspine mountains~
  Small trails amidst the huge boulders and crags can be found which gives
some light of hope in traveling though these mountains.  The mountain
continues ascending to the east while it descends to the west, north and south
are more of the same altitude, just more red rock.
  It appears the mountain ends in some hills to the west while the continues
up to the east.  More crags and rock lie to the north and south.

yourself inside a bottomless crevice.  The mountain seems to come to a end
to the southeast where the rock ends in a cliff that falls for several
hundreds of feet to a valley below.  There seems to be a small dusty trail
that leads along this crest to the north while traveling east past some
of the huge rock towers.
  It looks as though the cliff continues to travel to the northeast, angling
its way into the red rock.

Travelers road~
  The small path weaves its way through the towers of rock and crevices here
as you look about the entire area around you, this is the crest of the
redspine.  Far to the west you can see a expanse of grassland and hills while
to the east a sea of hills is all you see.
  This small path continues down the sides of the mountain to the east and
west.  A small trail can be made out spawning from the road leading north
along the crest.

Redspine crest~
  The crest of the mountain looks out over all else here, to the far west
you can see a great expanse of hills and grasslands while to the east there
seems to be no end to the foothills you can see expanding.  Through the rocks
and crags to the south it appears the crest ends and the slope travels down
a bit, as it does to the east and west.
  The mountain defends to the east, west, and south while the crest continues
to the north.

where a cliff lies.

  A cliff drops from the towers of rock and deep crags to the east and south
of you.  Looking over the cliff, as it angles to the northeast and southwest,
there seems to be a valley hundreds of feet below you.  Near the cliff to the
east, past a few huge towers of rock, there appears to be a tall stone
building made of the red rock and very beautiful.
  The mountain seems to ascend to the north while descending a bit to the west.
A majestic building seems to have a entrance to the east, past a couple huge
towers of rock.

Travelers road~
  This small road weaves in and out of huge towers of red rock that thrust
hight into the sky, while evading crags and caves that reach down into the
bowels of the mountain.  Travel here is easier because of the small trail
but in the mountain looks even more dangerous.
  This road descends to the east while ascending to the west.  The red rock
of the redspine lies elsewhere.

Redspine mountains~
  Huge towers of red rock thrust out from the mountainside while other areas
have caved in making huge crevices and cracks.  Travel amongst these
elements is very difficult, every step must be watched carefully or you would
find yourself inside a bottomless crevice.  The mountain face is very
steep and ascends to the east while slopes off to the west and descends.

Redspine crest~
  The crest of the redspine seems to continue far out of your vision to the
east while to the west it seems to drop off quickly at a cliff.  The jagged
rock leads down both sides of the mountain to the north and south at very
steep angles making travel very difficult.
  The redspine lies all about you except to the west where a cliff falls off
into a valley below.

Redspine crest~
  The crest of the redspine continues to the east and west through jagged
pieces of rock and shallow crags.  This high up you can see well about you,
to the north there appears to be a expanse of grasslands while to the south
there appears to be a sea.  Also, far to the south, a single mountain spire
raises high above even your height, into the clouds above.
  The redspine descends to the north and south while the crest continues to

  Jagged towers of red rock jut out all around you making travel here very
difficult not to mention dangerous.  One wrong step and you could be at the
bottom of one of the crags that litter the mountain side burrowing into the
bowels of the mountain.  There appears to be a trail further down the mountain
that edges a cliff, north and west continuing south.
  The redspine lies all about you while to the west the mountain side seems
to ascend a bit.

  You are on a road that winds through a dense forest.  From the west you can
hear the sound of a swiftly moving river, and to the east the forest lightens
and gives way to grassy plains.  It becomes darker as you travel further

be well traveled by both animals and people.

Rocky Beach~
  You are on a rock covered beach on the western side of a horseshoe bend in
the river.  There are several pools where the water forms eddies that you could
easily lower a boat into to safely enter the river.  Though swift, the river
does not seem too fast or rough at this point to prevent travel up or
downstream.  A small waterfall trickles down the stones to your north, and
flows into one of the pools.
  A path leads across the rocks up to the forest to the west, and there is a
large pool leading into the river to the south.

  Briars and dead plants catch on your clothing and armor as you force your
way through the blackberry bushes here.  Most of the blackberries seem to have
been picked already, as all you've noticed are the thorns.  It is very
difficult to move around in here.
  The thicket continues to the north, where you can see more briars, and to
the east you believe you can exit back into the forest proper.  The underbrush

  You deftly avoid crashing you craft upon the rocks, and allow the current to
carry you safely downriver.  The current here is quite strong, and the river
is becoming very rough.  It is going to be a bumpy ride, and it only seems
worse downriver.  Rocks jut randomly from the water, causing you to spend
every second in attempts to avoid crashing your boat. The banks are being torn
at by the force of the current, and seem to wear away right before your eyes.

Deadly rocks~
  You push boldly forward, choosing not to give way to your better sense.  The
water boils around you, and your craft is tossed roughly about.  Suddenly, you
find yourself heading unstoppably towards a large outcrop of huge rocks in
the middle of the river.  You try frantically to regain control, but to no
avail...obviously it is best to be slow and careful in the rapids...your boat
suddenly is shot high into the air, skimming over the rocks.  You crash into
a section of the river without quite so many rocks, and amazingly manage to
keep from falling overboard.  You are safe...this time.
  It seems that you should just let the current carry you through the rapids.

Large rocks loom just ahead, and then suddenly, you are thrown from your boat
as it is dashed to splinters upon the hard stone.  The river grabs ahold of
you, sucking you under into its wet, deadly embrace, forcing the air from your
lungs.  Air...precious air.... You briefly surface, and gasp for another
breath, just as your head is mauled against something hard.
  The world goes black, and you sink forever into a watery grave.

Sanctuary of Pastue~
  This small room seems to void of most basic furniture except a small cot and
a burning stove to replace some of the warmth.  Placed directly in the center
of this home, covered in flowers and offerings to the four elements stands
spotless and peaceful.  There is a sense of inner peace within this room,
perhaps it has something to do with this beautiful altar.

Grassland~
  Grassland lies all about you in every direction.  Looking through the
sea of grass, a few miles perhaps, lies what appears to be several buildings,
perhaps even a village.  Here, you stand in the middle of a small ring
made of mushrooms.
  Grassland lies all about you.

  The flat expanse of the grassland lies about you.  Through the tall, thick
grass you think you might see a break in the layer miles to the south.
Everywhere else is just the sweet smell of nature, and a sea of flowing
grassland.
  A road lies to the south while grassland everywhere else.

Wood~
  The dense canopy of this wood holds out almost all of the light from above
although the ground growth between the trees is heavy.  There is a warm breeze
that blows through this wood despite its height in the mountains.  Just to the
south of you there is a large wall with lots of moss growing upon it which
must be the center wall of the city.
  You can follow wood to the east and west of here.

Wood~
  The canopy of the wood restricts the light flow that comes in to a minimum
as the trees to the east have grown so close together that any passage is
almost impossible.  To the north you think you see through the dense trees
a beam of light descending upon a large stump up ahead.  A large wall lies to
the south which must be the center wall of the city.
  You can follow the wood to the north and west from here.

  Just to the east you can see that the sewer opens up into daylight as the
tunnel ends as a whole in the cliffside.  A steady stream of clear water, from
beneath the top layer of refuse, flows out of the tunnel and makes a tiny
waterfall, crashing hundreds of feet below.  A small set of slippery stairs
can be seen just to the left of the flow, leading down the cliff.

to the east, the door of which faces another, much larger door which is
obviously much more protective and seems to lead straight into the cave wall.

Carved cave~
  This cave seems to have been carved with a bit more care as there are not
quite as many holes and pieces of rock laying about.  The smell here is
repugnant, one of must and decay.  The bones that line the cave cave wall are
broken and scared, obviously of someone who was badly hurt or beaten.
  There are some locked iron doors to the north and south, while this cave

  The water rushes frantically around you as you are plummeting toward a

of the waterfall and will soon fall aimlessly toward the crashing water

the current is not strong at all although the spewing water from the falls
will not let you close to it.  The river soon turns westward as it follows
a cliff which rises hundreds of feet, although a thick layer of mist prevents
you from seeing that far up it.  Opposite the cliff lie trees that appear

it out.  Further to the east you can see that a small trickle of water down
the side of a cliff is what has formed the small pool.  The gnarled roots
and thick branches haunch about you, some diving into the pool, as if
drinking its life.

lie about you in force.  There is a steady stream of water that flows down
from above, its origin is above the thick layer of mist though.  The roots
about the area dive deep within the pool as many branches hang low, some
of the moss actually touching the waters surface.  The rock seems to have
a wet stair carved into it leading up into the mist.

hardly any movement at all.  It is impossible to see where the roots, or
the trees originate from, it is as if they all are from the same tree, hard
black bark, and almost moving as you look at them.

  Tangled roots and huge tree trunks surround you only several feet away
in every direction obscuring any view other than a few feet away.  Many
strange pieces of moss and other odd plant growth intermingle with the aged
roots and huge trunk that are about you.  The ever present mist weaves through
the tangled mesh in layers of increasing thickness as it travels through
the canopy above, almost trapped within this net of life.

you can see boats being built and several buildings standing tall.  There
even seems to be a small worn path in the sand that serves as some sort of
a village road.

the area encased within he driftwood wall, although the eastern side seems
to hold several buildings and huts.  Further to the north there appears to
be a large podium of sorts upon which stand several people.

Near the top, where four walls come together in a point, a scone hangs on
several strong chains providing ample light from what lies within.  Almost
directly below the scone there stands a altar made from the gnarled wood
of the forest.  Its branches seem to be coated with blood and small pieces
of flesh that have clung to it.  The rest of the chamber seems to be clad
in various rugs and other materials to make it a facade of lasciviousness.
  A archway leads west from here.

altar roots branches gnarled~
  The altar has tangled itself into a mesh of tight roots that form a
large altar almost six feet long and three wide.  The blood that coats the
roots almost makes them seethe with life.

  The scone looks like nothing more than a large bronze pot that seems
to hold something that burns continuously lighting up this entire chamber.

  The land about you seems to be decaying as you look upon it, blades of
once tall and strong grass have now wilted and turned a dark shade of
brown.  Just to the north hills begin to rise up while eastward and
westward rock cliffs rise high above you making this a desolate valley.
  Hills lie to the north while more desolate land lies all but east.

  Small drops of water fall from various stalactites which reach down from

a culmination of churning waters that seem to smash into the floor, leaving
no trace other than the drops that spill from it.  There is almost a foot
of water on the floor of this cave, murky and dark.  It almost matches the
air which seems quite musty and stagnant.  The walls of this cave are
covered in shells of various sizes, along with large pieces of a unusual
rock.

  A soft blue glows lights up the salty waters all about you as buoyancy
finds its station.  Above, the water seems to grow slightly darker though
still lit enough to see several yards around.  Beneath your buoyant form
the coral covered bottom gleams off light into the dark waters around you,
each of the corrals spewing a myriad of colors from the lichens which grow
upon them.
  The salty waters continue all but north and west.

Deep coral~
  Coral is pack densely this deep into the reef, much of it scratched badly
and broken in many parts.  There are very small bits of lichen about though
it isn't enough to provide any sort of light to the dark corrals that lie
this far down within the reef.  This seems to be some sort of distinct tunnel
which something has carved from the coral itself.
  The coral tunnel leads north and west.

Coral cavern~
  Bright pieces of coral lie all about you, most lit by small lichens that
grow upon them.  The corrals look quite sharp and could cut you quite badly
if you make a wrong move.  Small fish and other sea creatures seem to be
abundant here, partially covered from harm in the waters above by this thick
layer of coral.  A hole beneath this light coral leads into a darker form
of what lies about you now, there doesn't seem to be any lichen growth there.
  One could travel further into the deeper coral or pass upward into the open
waters.

Small pool~
  A small surface of water lies upon this mound of coral rock which seems
to protrude from the grey rock which makes up this large chamber.  About
you long pillars of grey rock rise to the ceiling high above.  Looking into
the water it is quite apparent there is some sort of a large shell at the
bottom of this small pool.
  The chamber lies in all directions while a shell lies at the bottom of

  Razor sharp rocks jut out of the walls as you venture slowly down the path

the passageway.  The smooth path guides you through the jagged rocks that
await your first slip.  A cool drop of water can be heard splashing off in
the dark.  Every so often the remains of  what once may have been a lost
adventure lie scattered in the rocks.

Before the Gates of Rylis~
  As you emerge for the darkness of the cavern you stand before two large
blacken gates.  The sounds of thousands of screaming souls flow out from
behind the the great city walls.  Guards dressed in black armor walk the
walls above, moving as if they float above the walkways themselves.
In the distance through the gates an enormous castle reaches upwards and
disappears into the darkend fog that floats above the city.

Graveyard~
  A thick, low lying mist obscures the ground here as gray, solemn
tombstones thrust up at odd angles.  You trip over a mound of dirt
and look in horror as you realize it is earth from a freshly dug
grave.  The cavernous wall of the temple lies to the east.

  The low lying mist here conceals the ground but the stark tombstones

Path~

rubble on the path, that no one has been here in a long time.
  The path leads north to a gate while south into the mountains.

vision is not great in any.  Looking to the east, just past a hill it looks
as though the mountain reaches the ground at a absurd angle, elsewhere the
hills continue.
  Hills lie all about you.

  The red rock of the mountain before looks as though it has been shaved off
at almost a perfect angle.  The mountainside goes straight into the air here
with no apparent way up.  It continues  around to the south and north where
it appears to become more manageable and easier to climb.
  Hills lie to the north and east while the sheer face of the mountainside
lie to the south and west, which appears to have a slight crevice in it.

  Passing by a large hill, to the south you can see that the mountainside
comes to a almost ninety degree angle with the hills below.  The red rock
of the mountain spans high into th sky as this continues for some distance
to the west and shortly to the east seems to angle southward, all at this
incredible angle.
  Hills lie in every direction except south where the sheer face of the
mountainside rests.

run north by south along the edge of the hills. Far off to the
south you can see the shadowy tips of the Black Mountains.
  Directly to your south are the waters of the Rainwash river,
cutting eastward across the hills.

The Rainwash River~
  Water flows rapidly in an eastern direction away from the
Redspine Mountains. The current is strong making it impossible
to swim this river.
  To the south you can see endless hills covering the most of
your view. All along the western border of the hills lie the
Redspine Mountains. Way off in the south you can barely make
out the highest peaks of the Black Mountains.

Under the bridge~
  The Rainwash runs directly under an ancient stone bridge here.
Looking to the sides of the bridge you can see no trail or road
leading to or from it attesting to the age of the bridge.
  At one time the bridge was incarntately designed with many
carvings and inscriptions. Now all the decoration has faded to
mere lines and bumps along the surface.

On the bridge~
  You are standing at the crest of the old stone bridge. Looking
about you a great view of the hills and the lands surrounding
is given.
  Off to the west the rust colored Redspine Mountains rise into the
heavens. Likewise the darker range of the Black Mountains rises into
the sky further off to the south. The waters of the Rainwash River
run eastward under the bridge; on their long journey to the ocean
far off to the east.
  Other than that there is nothing to see except for hill after
hill rising and falling in the distance.

of the peaks of the Black Mountains can be seen.
  On the face of the hill upon which you are standing is a dark
cave. Looking down at it you smell an awful stench reeking out
of it. To inspect further you need to walk down the side of the
hill and around to its face.
  To the north the waters of the Rainwash River can be seen. An
old stone bridge crosses them.

Inside the cave~
  The scent in this cave is horrid. Flies buzz around a few fresh
corpses. Bones litter much of the area. A vast collection of broken
weapons and armors is heaped up in the back of the cave. A tattered
skin is spread across part of the floor. The opening to the cave leads
out to the south.

corpses~
  The corpses are of a few humans who look to be of the adventurer type.
Unfortunately for them they weren't strong enough to withstand the
might of the hill giants. Dried, cracking blood is all over their flesh
and the floor about them.
~

weapons~
  A small heap of weapons of all sorts lies on the ground. Most of them
are broken. None of the ones that are whole look useable to any but
the most meager of warriors.

armors~
  Intermixed with the weapons are various pieces of armor and shields. They
are all dented and worthless.
~
E
skin~
  The skin is a patchwork of a number of smaller skins. It covers the most
of the back part of the cave's floor. With a brooding feeling of horror
you realize that the skin is that of various humanoids; much like your
own.

The Rainwash River~
  Water flows rapidly in an eastern direction away from the
Redspine Mountains, which lie to the west. The current is strong,
making it impossible to swim this river.
  To the south you can see endless hills covering the most of your
view. Way off in the south you can barely make out the highest
peaks of the Black Mountains.

The Rainwash River~
  Water flows rapidly in an eastern direction away from the
Redspine Mountains, which lie to the west. The current is strong,
making it impossible to swim this river.
  To the south you can see endless hills covering the most of your
view. Way off in the south you can barely make out the highest
peaks of the Black Mountains.

The Rainwash River~
  Water flows rapidly to the east here. Swimming without a boat is
certainly impossible. High hills line the sides of the river, blocking
your vision.
  You can, however, see a great forest to the east. Over the tops of
the hills you can also see the Black Mountains to the south, and the
Redspine Mountains to the west.

sign hanging over the second building but you can't make out what
it says from this distance.

Scandra's Supply Shop~
  This small and dingy shack displays a great variety of items that
might prove useful to the traveler. Shelves full of various necessity
line every wall. Crates are piled up in somewhat neat stacks around
the floor to display their contents.
  Against the northern wall of the room is a small counter. Behind that
counter is a shelf displaying a few of the more valueable items. A door
lies behind that counter.
  The quality of the wares is acceptable, but surely nothing exceptional.
The wares displayed to the street in the window were a fairly accurate
account of what is available.
  The door to the Travelers Road is south of you.

Edge of the hills~
  You are standing on the northeastern edge of a great plain of hills.
Far, far off to the west the rust colored peaks of the Redspine Mountains
are barely visible. Southward you can see the Black Mountains dominate
the southern skyline. A great forest is directly east of this last hill
on which you stand. The foilage looks dense and hardly passable.
  South of you there is also the Rainwash River. Running its course
eastward and into the forest.

The Rainwash River~
  The river is now running past the eastern edge of the hills. Directly
to your east the river runs into darkness under the eaves of the trees.
There are no paths apparent at the sides of the river in the forest.
  Two great mountain ranges can be seen from here. Far to the west
lie the Redspine Mountains, almost a similar distance to the south
lie the Black Mountains. Between the mountains and your current location,
nothing save for hills is to be seen.

The Travelers Rest~
  The air in this building is a bit hard to breathe. Between the smell
of alcoholic drinks and the lingering scent of burning lamp oil there
is little room for the true air to be breathed.
  The room itself is fairly simple. There are five tables arranged
randomly around the place. Each table has four chairs tucked under
it. On the eastern side of the room a long wooden bar with a number
of stools lines the wall. Behind the bar is a large sign displaying
the available drinks.
  An open doorway to the south leads to the back half of the inn,
where travelers go to attain a room for the evening.

The Travelers Rest~
  Standing in the back part of the inn you find that the air is much more
pure and easier to breathe. There is a small desk here, resting beside
the entrance to a long hallway that runs down the back of the inn.
  A few wooden floorboards creak and groan as you walk up to the desk
but the place has a study and stubborn feel to it as a whole. As you
approach the desk you notice a small sign resting on the corner of it.

  You are standing on the eastern edge of a great plain of hills. Directly
to your east is a vast impenetrable forest. To the south the Black
Mountains run the length of the horizon; closing in on the forest as they
edge eastward. Far to the west the rust colored figures of the Redspine
Mountains loom over the far side of the hills.

Outside the temple~
  The field here is dominated by the frontal face of what is obviously a
large temple. Two large iron doors center the temple. The form of a whip
with six barbed hooks clawing out of the ends of its heads is carved into
both of the doors. Above the doors is a large statue. The temple is made
from stone and bears little decoration. To the east and west the field leads
away from the face of this somber temple.

  The doors and their carving are not crude, nor are they delicate features
of art. They seem to be just there serving their purpose. Looking
closer at the carving you see some runes written in the Old Tongue that
translate roughly into "The House of the Lady Lovitar".

digging into his flesh. The flail pulls down from below the man and

Inside the doors of the temple~
  The featureless stone walls of the temple rise twenty feet above your head.
The floor and ceiling are made from the same dull grey stone. There is no
decoration at all in this place. Light is provided from two torches that
hang to the sides of the entryway.
  Long halls lead off to the north, east and west; each lighted by torches
that hang every twenty feet or so on the walls. The halls to the east and
west both terminate after a visible distance, taking a turn to the north.
The northern hall leads past a few doorways and into a large open room
that is not very visible at this distance.
  To the south is the exit of the temple.

  The hall takes a turn to the north and the west here. Looking down the
northward end you see that it leads some distance with its dull monotony.
A torch here and there provides light, but there is no decoration or
adornment here at all.
  A similar view is given to the west. The only difference is that there
is an entryway of sorts a bit to the west.
  Whoever made this place had no taste for the esthetic. All there is to see
is dull stone and torchlight.

  To the east and west you can see a great figure rising up along each of
the walls. It is impossible to grasp the nature of the figures due to
the low amount of detail the veils allow.

To the south, a hallway leads out of the chamber. Two torches hang to
the sides of the hall providing light for this area.

is circled by a number of fat black candles. The scent of incense lingers
in the air. It has a thick and spicy quality to it.
  Evil pours from the area. It seems focused on the slab. It is just now
that you notice leather straps attached to the corners of the slab. The
idea that it might be a sacrificial table seems quite valid right now.
  To the south there is a large hanging veil. Behind that veil is what
must be the entrance to this chamber.

Faerie Ring~
  Looking around, you notice that the sky has gotten considerably
darker... Not the usual purpling of evening, but a rich, deep azure
that seems very out of place.  Your eyes wander to the mushrooms and
the grass beyond.  With a start, you notice you are standing atop a
large mound of short, stubby grass!  The mushrooms offer no answer.
  You see a small path leading down to the west, and a dark and
scary path edging down to the east.

cold feel to the otherwise warm evening.

mushroom mushrooms~
  The mushrooms are very large, white toadstools.  There are a few smaller
elephant ears, and some others you don't recognize, scattered in amongst them.
The only thing really odd about these silent companions is the very faint glow
that seems to be there one minute, and gone the next.

A Small Path~
  The path you are walking along is clear and free of debris.  The
bushes and trees to either side seem to have tried to grow over it, but
they cringe back... Almost as if some mysterious force holds them at bay.
You get the feeling that if they wanted to, the trees might just decide
to lean over and rip you to shreds!
  The path continues to the west, while a smaller, more shrouded trail
bends away to the north.  A dark hole is curiously clear of branches
under the bushes to the south.

  The trail you trod upon is uneven and filthy.  Dust rises in small puffs
with each and every step you take.  The trees around here are thick with
foliage, and grow very close to the path.  Every so often, you stumble over
a root that stretches across the road, even though you never seem to see
them before you've tripped over them.
  The clear and even path you started on lies back to the south, while
this irritatingly dingy road winds into a dark cave to the east.

  The cave is very dark, and your pitiful light doesn't disturb it very
much at all.  The air is at once musty and sharply cold, the scent is odd
and combines the worst elements of decay, death, and fear.  You are sure
that some very, very large beast is about to come charging out of the
blackness and make you into a nice little snack!
  A faint glimmer of light offers the hope of escape to the west.

Under the Bush~
  You manage to wriggle into the space under the thick canopy of brush
and brambles.  Of course, you've managed to scrape yourself bloody in
the process.  Now that you're here, you see the tight little tunnels
you've found go both east and west, deeper into the bushes.
  You think you can hear faint giggling, first from one side, then
from the other...

Under the Bush~
  Wonderful.  You have found a dead end.  The space under the bush you've
chosen to grub about in has just closed off and you find yourself staring
at a thick wall of thorns and leaves.  You have little choice but to
worm your way back west.
  The giggling erupts into high-pitched laughter behind you and a quick
pattering of feet.

A Small Path~
  You are walking on a smooth dirt path.  Thick bushes line the edges of
the road and seem to hold back the myriad twisted and alien shapes of the
dark trees that loom over you.  The branches seem almost fluid in the odd
half-light of this strange land, and you could swear that something moved
on that one to the left.
  The path continues, gently down to the west, and slants gradually up
towards a small hill to the east.

A Small Path~
  You are walking on a smooth dirt path.  Thick bushes line the edges of
the road and seem to hold back the myriad twisted and alien shapes of the
dark trees that loom over you.  A small clearing lurks to the south, and
you catch a glimpse of a strange mottled white dome.  It could be a house
of some unusual design.
  The path continues towards a bend in the west, and slants gently up
to the east.

Outside the Mushroom House~
  You are standing in a small clearing just south of a road.  The trees seem
lighter here, almost friendly.  The grass grows long and thick, and just to
the east is the strangest building you have ever seen!  It appears to be a
gigantic mushroom, complete with a polished red frontdoor, several windows,
and a chimney in the centre.  A thin wisp of smoke rises from it.
  You can enter the house to the east, or return to the dark path northward.

  The chimney is made of stone.  A thin wisp of smoke rises from it, but it
looks like the fire has just about died.  Still, someone can't be too far
away!

mushroom house~
  Yes, it really DOES look like a gigantic mushroom!  You suppose it could
be made of wattle and daub, but it doesn't have the patchy falling-apart
look that most peasant homes have.  It LOOKS like a living organism.

barren Puyallup.  The wall to the right has righting on it in black marker.
An ebony and steel necked guitar rests carefully against a weather beaten
mahogany desk. A large door leads southward.

                  The Ritual, to the Best of my Recollection
                                by -H-

         From the focus of my heart, I call the words
         Of anger spoken and desire revealed
         By my challenge of word and deed
         By my blood consecrate thy bane invoked
         Thy shape and form decreed never was.
                          -@-
         On thy physical form, I call the words of rendering.
         On thy hates, I invoke justice, the anger unappeased.
         On thy past in shadows, I shine the light revealed.
         On thy loves and joys, I gift separation.
         On thy spirit, I speak abandonment.
         On thy future, I bring fear and grief.
         On thee I invoke all.
                          -@-
         The winds shall erase thy name
         The sands the traces of thy path
         The sun the coolness of thy shadow
         And unto the waters I command thy essence
         Thy shape and form decreed never was

Above the Southwind Tower~
   You are above a large, forty story skyscraper.  It's roof has
collapsed, showing what used to be a plush office below you, but is now
filled with dust and rotting furniture.  The winds from the barren plains
of the puyallup buffet you, and howl about the eaves of the deserted
building.

you can see the stairs winding themselves all the way up as far as you
can see.  A dank, musty smell pervades this area and water is quietly
dripping into a stagnant puddle in the corner.  A door to the south,
hanging slightly ajar, reads "Lobby".

the wind howls through the ragged holes and sweeps the dust and sand about
the once plush carpeting, now gone threadbare and dirty.  A reception
desk is here, rotting away and covered with dust.  To the north is a metal
door, hanging slightly ajar, that reads "Stairs".  To the west is an
elevator door with an "Out of Order" sign hanging on it.

The Laughing Parrot Toy Shop~
   The whole place is filled with all manner of wooden toys to delight
children, and the adult child at heart.  It's hard to resist the urge
to hop on one of the hobby horses and ride it back and forth.  There
are racks of stick and hoop games, and one whole wall is devoted to
dolls of every type and size.  The noise from the various children running
about and playing in here is rather loud.

Temple of Melikki~
   This incredible structure draws crowds from all over the city,
as well as from outside the city.  Many come to pray or pay homage, but
many others come just to look upon it.  The druids of Melikki have created
an entire grove within this large temple.  Trees and plants fill the entire
place, with a huge, gnarled oak dominating the center.  A large dome made
of clear glass lies overhead, providing sunlight to the plants and
myriad animals living within this indoor grove.  A stone path leads east
towards the large oak.

wall of stone blocks any passage east.

Great River of Nesthar~
  The murky waters to this river don't seem to flow
in any direction.  Large trees hang over the banks and
break the surface of the river with there branches and
long vines.  The river flows into a huge lake to the
south, the water is crystal clear.  There seems to be a
damn of sorts barring passage into the river.
  A vast jungle lies to the west and east.  The river
continues north while a lake lies to the south.

Dense fog~
  The air here is so thick and murky that you can't see more
than three feet in front of you.  The ground below your feet
feel as if they are being sucked down into a thick mud.

Murky Swamp~
  The fog thins out here and you can make out your surroundings.
You find yourself standing ankle deep in sticky mud.  A smell
reeking of dead flesh hangs in the air.  Thick vegetation sprouts
up from the mud making travel difficult.
  The fog thickins to the north and south.  To the east and west
lie more swamplands.

  To the east lies a skylight.  An unnatural warmth fills the area as your
eyes detect dancing red and green lights that encompass the entire area and you

Ivory Base and a Silver rose pinned to his lapel.  On either wall you see a

Courtyard~
  Flower gardens line both sides of the trail leading to a huge door.
The path splits and then reconnects as it circles a statue of Tyken. The
statue grins at you giving you the feeling that it is alive.  A soft warm

with their aroma.
