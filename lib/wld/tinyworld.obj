Welcome to WileyMUD III

Death is commonplace here.  If you wish to die infrequenly, consider a few
pointers:
 1> Use the consider command.
    This command will help you by giving you a fairly good idea how well you
    can take a mob.  Remember that the consider command will not factor in
    damage from a mob's weapon.  Look and see if the mob has a weapon and
    consider not attacking a mob.
 2> Set wimp mode.
    Entering the wimp command will automatically cause you to flee for the
    first three levels of the game if your hit points drop too low.
 3> Be aware that almost all mobs will remember you and some will track you.
    If you attack a mob and have to flee, the mob will frequently attempt to
    track you and kill you when it finds you.  If you must, duck into Griffin's
    Tale, where no fighting is allowed.  When fleeing, move away a few rooms
    to try to lose the trail of any mob which is following you.
 4> Stay really close to Shylar for the first few levels, or leave in groups.
    Most of the mobs in Shylar are fairly easy (except the shopkeepers,
    guildmasters, and Eli).  Outside of Shylar, you are TOAST!
 5> The most important item: Expect to die!

							"The History of the Castle Bazzak"

  Not so long ago, this castle was a grand place, known throughout
the land.  My father, the king of this castle, ruled the Black
Mountains and surrounding grasslands and maintained peace in the
land.  
  In more recent times, however, things became not so pleasant.
Ten years ago, a dark shadow fell over the area.  Soon there
were constant raids by undead and ogres against our castle and
the many tiny villages which once thrived in these lands.
	My father, the king, offered this castle as home for those
who had survived the initial raids.  He began leading troops
into the mountains in an attempt to reclaim his land.  Each time,
he gave me the same orders.
	His instructions were plain.  If he were not to return, I was
to inherit the throne.  The castle was to be locked up, and no
evil be allowed to penetrate its walls.  For years now, that is
exactly what we have done.
	I do not know what fate my father came to.  My prayers are still
that he has simply been captured and will someday return to rid the
land of evil.
