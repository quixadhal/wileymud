1993-02-02 23:55:32-08	3098	1	Cyric	Titles	Please don't give titles that are misleading to a characters\n\rlevel, avatar is rather high on my list :) even if it is for a\n\rpiece of tail...grin\n\r\n\rCyric\n\r
1993-02-04 15:06:43-08	3098	2	Harlequin	titles	*cackle* I know, I was not aware of the Reserved status of Avatar\n\runtil Tim mentioned it to me.  I was going to change it next time\n\rI was on, but ya beat me to it...:)\n\r
1993-02-04 16:55:46-08	3098	3	Cyric	Tail	well, did you get it :)\n\r
1993-02-04 20:11:54-08	3098	4	Harlequin	Re: Tail	Hell no.  You know me, I never get anythng anymore.  Hey, I\n\rnoticed an odd thing.  I was polymorphed in the shape of a giant\n\rtick and was killed by succubus.  I just returned to my original\n\rbody.  Is this because I'm an immort, or will that happen to\n\rplayers also?  Shouldn't they die if they die in polymorphed\n\rform?\n\r
1993-02-09 02:04:32-08	3098	5	Muth	Who/Pager	Suggestion:\n\rCyric, could you please put a page break in the command 'who'.\n\rSo many people now it scrolls off.  8)\n\r\n\rThanks!\n\r<M>\n\r
1993-02-11 03:24:07-08	3098	6	Muidnar	names	Well I was on and I had person come on the game as *sshole. the\n\rsite number is rs6007.esc.rpi.edu put when I tried to finger it I\n\rcouldn't?? What do you do in this case? purge <name> didn;t work\n\rand well... um slay killed him ;)\n\r\n\r                          See ya\n\r
1993-02-12 03:15:08-08	3098	7	Muidnar	Charm?	You know I've only been a Wiz for a little while and it seems I'm\n\rgoing drive you nuts. Well here we go.\n\r1. What do you do about mutli char by one person.\n\r2. Charm person works. Goodwind is running around using it. On a\n\r   lot of people.\n\r3. MUTH people LUV Drenth!  just though you should know :)\n\r\n\r                                 Later \n\r
1993-02-12 12:31:49-08	3098	8	Muth	Charm	-= People with multiple characters must quit with one or more\n\r   leaving only one on the game.  Players are given 3 warnings on\n\r   this subject, each time a warning is given out post it to the\n\r   board here so we all know what the situation is if we catch that\n\r   same person later.  Help rules explains what the warnings mean i\n\r   think.\n\r-= Charm person works?  Cyrics department sorry.  cackle\n\r-= People love drenth?  Great!  I was cackling to to myself\n\r   working on it hoping it would cause mass suffrage, and a bit of a\n\r   challenge.  8)\n\r\n\r<M>\n\r
1993-02-13 19:49:45-08	3098	9	Muidnar	board	well there I saw a character on today 11/11/11 his name is\n\raladdin and is character is only 17 years old 1 month so that\n\rwould mean the char has been around for a not even a week??? Just\n\rgeneral info\n\r
1993-02-13 21:12:56-08	3098	10	Muidnar	Grrrrr	Well I gave Xavier,Malrot,Beldore,Voytek there first warning for\n\rmulit char playing. I must admit it was a very nice killing group\n\r:)\n\r
1993-02-14 01:21:05-08	3098	11	Daisy	Re; board	:)  I set up a character on Friday for taking small groups of\n\rnewer payers out on Friday [Aladdin].   Or even large groups.  :)\n\rDidn't mean to make it  all 11th level but was too lazy to drain\n\rit back down.  It's not going to be used for anything but this\n\rpurpose.  I seem to recall Cyric saying this was okay to do.\n\rCorrect me if I'm wrong...\n\r\n\rDaisy\n\r
1993-02-14 16:18:26-08	3098	12	Muidnar	board	I didn't know that Daisy :) I just came on and saw aladdin with\n\r11/11/11 and I had never seen him before.  So then you are the\n\rone that plays aladdin :) Thats cool. I though it was kind of\n\rfunny that the char was only 17 and 11/11/11. (grin)\n\r
1993-02-14 18:45:10-08	3098	13	Cyric	Aladdin2	It is okay to play characters that Immorts jack up, I talked with\n\raladdin and asked that he not play this character anymore.  His\n\rexcuse what that he was using this character for helping newbies\n\rout. But when I found him he was adventuring by himself going to\n\rareas that his normal character could not have reached.\n\r
1995-11-19 02:59:59-08	3098	14	Quixadhal	ADMIN: GAP	There appears to be a gap in the board file records here.\n\rSome weeks were lost.\n\r
1995-11-19 04:05:31-08	3098	15	Quixadhal	group spells and resets	First, I figured out the reason that most DikuMUDs reboot at\n\rleast once a day.  LpMUDs reboot to free lost memory... dikus\n\rreboot because the reset code is broken!\n\r\n\rI need a volunteer to look at how the zone resets happen, and\n\rpossibly rewrite part or all of it, so that it works as one\n\rexpects it to.  The game is less fun if chests filled with\n\rmagical items are empty because someone sold the item and thus it\n\rwon't create another one.\n\r
1995-12-20 08:03:09-08	3098	16	Quixadhal	Meeting Results...	Hmmmm... results?  Were there any?  We DID kill off Malistrum and\n\rcripple Zar.  I think I outlined what we had done and what was in\n\rthe works fairly well.  Now, who is working on what?  Highlander\n\rhas his drow area in place.  A little more work to spruce it up\n\rwould be nice... and maybe a few more wandering critters.. but\n\rgood job so far!\n\r\n\rZar claims to be working on a paladin keep to be put in Serpent's\n\rReach... and Dirk claims to be working on Serpent's Reach when he\n\rgets back from Old People's Land.\n\r\n\rSedna and Zar will hopefully be getting together soon with me to\n\rhas out details about Nesthar.\n\r\n\rHighlander has also considered the idea of extending the\n\rUnderdark which would link into my own Faerie Village when I get\n\rthat done.\n\r\n\rMuidnar... Muidnar...  What is HE doing?\n\rPast glories are nice bub, but they don't buy the burger!  You\n\rneed to start hacking on something too.  Think about it and\n\rsuggest something.\n\r\n\rWhat am I doing?  Besides my twisted evil reincarnation of the\n\rFaerie Village from Smurfdom into a true Realm of the Fey... I've\n\ralso been and will continue to hack the code so we can add those\n\rnew classes (Paladins, Druids, Clerics of Good, Clerics of\n\rEvil...) and new spells (silence, entangle, insect swarm,\n\retc...).\n\r\n\rCheers!  Hope to hear from some of you!\n\r
1995-12-22 08:22:57-08	3098	17	Quixadhal	New BUGS, er... Features!	I've been doing ALOT of hacking over break.  This is primarily to\n\rinstall the low-level support that will allow us to extend\n\rWileyMUD in major ways such as adding new classes.  I'm also\n\rchanging things to be more balanced, and adding new features as I\n\rsee opportunities in my editing.  As a result, it is more than\n\rlikely I've buggered it up in a few places.  If anyone sees\n\rthings they think are bugs, PLEASE report them to any immortal\n\ronline or using the bug command.  I'm trying to get this thing\n\rupgraded while I have the time to code all day, but I need help\n\rto spot the places where I got too tired at 6am. :)\n\r
1996-02-05 21:52:13-08	3098	18	Quixadhal	Dumbass wizards	Hey Buttknockers!\n\r\n\rLet's not leave the game whizz locked unless something really\n\rneat is being done eh?  Geez.... like we're being SWAMPED with\n\rplayers....\n\r
1996-02-08 20:33:16-08	3098	19	Muidnar	????	wizlocked??? how many high level wizards do you have that can do\n\rthat???  by the way 5 players are on now.\n\rMay you rot in hell!\n\r\n\rMuidnar\n\r
1996-01-28 00:29:03-08	3099	58	Grimwell	Hermits!	Aw heck buddy, the point of the hermit is to make life tough :)\n\rHmmm, Hey Quix, you want any other generic messages? What's new\n\ron the mud? Any new areas? This crusty old magician can't\n\rremember much so it's most all new again, but divine inspiration\n\rwould be lovely :)\n\r\n\rMake Muidnar suffer\n\r\n\rGrimwell, master of the arcane "I Forgot's"\n\r\n\rp.s. I used to have a map too! :) **whooosh!**\n\r
2007-12-04 02:42:26-08	3099	86	Grimwell	If you are reading this...	You are one of the six people who read my blog. The one with\n\rinitiative. Welcome to the wayback machine!\n\r
2007-12-10 00:52:12-08	3099	87	Osiris	...halb, halb halb	Hiya!\n\r
1996-02-12 12:47:00-08	3098	20	Muidnar	Grimwell	An old wizard Grimwell wants to build again. I was reading the\n\rideas and typoo logs and saw his message. Yes people do read\n\rthose! Well those of us who know where they are at. Anyway Quix\n\rwhat do you think. His areas are good and need little changing\n\rwhen finished. and he will build unlike the rest. Well with the\n\rexecption of the drow area that was placed in by Highlander.\n\rUnlike wizards like Zar??? I think he is a wizard? when was the\n\rlast time he logged in????\n\r\n\rAlso why am I still 59th?\n\r\n\rWhy do I not have access to the world file?\n\rIt has only been about 6 months. I provided 3500 rooms to restore\n\rthis mud to its current condition how much longer do I have to\n\rwait?\n\r\n\rI also hate your typo lines. This is NOT MTV it is a mud with a\n\rmid-evil setting, If I'm not mistaken I believe that is what we\n\rwhere going to work on??? or am I wrong.\n\r\n\rHave a Day?\n\r\n\r                 Muidnar Hopes you rot in Hell\n\r
1996-02-14 06:45:51-08	3098	21	Dirk	typos	Oh c'mon Muidnar, lighten up. There's only one or two that say\n\ranything like MTV ;^) The rest are pretty funny, and are much\n\rmore interesting than the standard error message\n\r
1996-02-14 21:19:18-08	3098	22	Quixadhal	RE: Grimwell	Sure.  A wizard who actually builds areas... what a unique\n\rconcept!  Is THAT what they were supposed to do?  I thought they\n\rjust logged in and harassed the players every so often like me...\n\rok.\n\r\n\rFeel free  to whizzify him if he ever comes back :)\n\r
1996-02-15 20:36:43-08	3098	23	Muidnar	Grimwell	We can give him the Reach back being that was his original job,\n\rand no one else seems to be working on it. We need guild masters\n\rfor 15-20 for rangers.\n\r
1996-08-08 15:26:16-07	3098	24	Muidnar	wow	No one has put anything up here  in a while.\n\r
1996-09-11 03:41:36-07	3098	25	Quixadhal	RE:wow	You're right!  By the gods... oh, there aren't anymore...\n\r
1996-09-21 17:28:45-07	3098	26	Muidnar	sigh	still no access to the database.......????  oooo Quix!!!!!\n\r
1996-09-27 21:24:38-07	3098	27	Muidnar	QUIX	Still no access to the database....??? hmmmm do you not like me\n\ranymore????\n\r\n\r            Muhahahahahahahahahahahaha!!!\n\r
1996-10-08 22:14:01-07	3098	28	Muidnar	HEY!!!	Hey does anyone read this anymore???? You know the WIZARD BOARD!!\n\r\n\r                     may you all rot in HELL\n\r
1996-10-09 00:06:07-07	3098	29	Quixadhal	RE:HEY!!!	Yeah, you suck too.\n\r
1996-10-29 00:25:41-08	3098	30	Muidnar	biteme	Hey I think you should delete all wizards who don't reply to my\n\rmessage!!!  All you wizards can kiss my ass!!!!\n\r\n\r      Vile Muidnar the Dark One!\n\r\n\rNO comment?????\n\rfigures!!!!\n\r
1996-10-30 22:35:01-08	3098	31	Muidnar	Blowme	Why do still not have access to the data base???? I modified\n\rkarrn sorry chris!! hahahah\n\r
1996-10-30 22:36:09-08	3098	32	Quixadhal	RE:Blowme	Yeah, so did I... hope you like him.\n\rsmirk.\n\r
1996-11-04 22:04:29-08	3098	33	Muidnar	mud	Tim has posted a note to send dot mud players that dot is dead.\n\rThey may move here if they can hack it.... \n\r\n\rChris you need to see who is and is not a immort on the is game\n\rand explain to them unlike dot this mud is hard and immorts if\n\rnot building or testing should not be FUCKING with the players..\n\ror we will loose them. I also think you should make people who\n\rwant to be immorts at least make it to level 15 here so they\n\runderstand how hard it really is!!!  Yes I know that you didn't\n\reven make it level 15 but then again you have the code and I have\n\rthe world file together they will suffer!!\n\r\n\r                                     Chris\n\r
1999-03-30 19:33:42-08	3098	34	Quixadhal	The Land is Dead.	Hello fellow immortals.\n\r\n\rI am surely speaking mostly to myself, but perhaps a few of you\n\rhave survived.  I am sorry this place has been neglected for so\n\rlong, and I fear it will never be what it once was.  But perhaps\n\rwe can carry someof it with us to a new place.\n\r\n\rFarewell.\n\r
2004-07-25 03:33:27-07	3098	35	Quixadhal	The Land is Empty	The land of WileyMUD is empty, but perhaps you can bring life\n\rback to it?  It waits only for a firm hand to force order back\n\rinto the chaos!\n\r
2010-07-18 04:04:35-07	3098	36	Quixadhal	SQL boards!	So, I've now removed normal file-based boards and moved\n\reverything into SQL.  Hopefully, it works ok. :)\n\r
1993-01-07 12:52:04-08	3099	1	Machine	TO THE GODS!	Yesterday, I was on and the system hit some major lag or\n\rsomething because I    was sitting around for ten minutes and I\n\rgot no response, so I was forced to  terminate my link.  I had a\n\rcopper breastplate, a helm, a longblade, food, and  some padded\n\rleggings and sleeves.  Could I please get some of that stuff\n\rback?\n\r
1993-01-07 14:14:35-08	3099	2	Cyric	Consider	We posted along time ago about this Scruffy, the consider command\n\ris not a reliable means of judging your opponent.\n\r\n\rCyric\n\r
1993-01-07 16:03:41-08	3099	3	Alv	About AC again...	Well, my AC drops 2 steps....Ok that implies that my EQ isnt what\n\rit used to due to all the fights I've been in and so on....Then\n\rthere is the blacksmith..  He says that all of my EQ is OK....\n\r\n\rSo..here is an idea..make damaged EQ LOOK damaged and furthermore\n\rmake the Blacksmith a little more reliable.....i e make him\n\rwork...\n\r\n\rAnd a small favour for poor, death-pursued me....make the\n\rrecall-branch bit less expensive   :)\n\r\n\rThanks for your time!\n\rAlv the Elf\n\r
1993-01-07 16:33:47-08	3099	4	Muth	Info	It works again.\n\r
1993-01-21 07:55:51-08	3099	5	Ric	new weapons	How about some new weapons, this new wield two business has rendered most\n\rdecent backstabing weapons useless.\n\r
1993-01-21 13:57:42-08	3099	6	Muth	RE: weapons	Most of the weapons you were using for backstabbing shouldn't\n\rhave been used in the first place.  The longest sword you should\n\rbe able to use is a shortsword.  If there are items that are\n\rbeing used that seem to be longer than that please let me know as\n\rthey are bugs.\n\rShortsword\n\rDagger\n\rAny other short weapons.\n\rThe above should be the only weapons available.\n\r
1993-01-19 16:16:13-08	3099	7	Muth	Staff!!	If your message for wielding says 'You are forbidden to do that!'\n\rthen you cannot wield it do to your class.  Ie.  You are a cleric\n\rtrying to wield a weapon that has been enchanted only for mages\n\rto use.\n\r
1993-01-19 17:36:59-08	3099	8	Kharel	character one on again!	Well, i managed to get this char on, but i can't get Gnarl on\n\rwith macro or manual, sigh, one outta two ain't bad tho :)\n\rPaul.\n\r
1993-01-19 20:44:32-08	3099	9	Ender	sleeping Borg	I personally can think of\n\r
1993-01-27 02:59:59-08	3099	10	Quixadhal	ADMIN: GAP	There appears to be a gap in the board file records here.\n\rSome weeks were lost.\n\r
1993-01-27 03:44:45-08	3099	11	Cyric	New	new commands:\n\r\n\rnoteleport, nosummon.\n\r\n\rThis will allow you to choose if you wish to have either of the\n\rspells by the same name affect you or not, this is by the way\n\ronly for PC -> PC.  A mob can still cast either of these on you\n\rthough.\n\r\n\rYou should not be able to kill another player UNLESS you and\n\rhe/she are both registerd for player killing. If this is wrong,\n\rplease let me know. I am going to great lengths to make this\n\rplace fun for those that do not wish to be attacked by players.\n\r\n\rThis includes area affect spells :)\n\r\n\rCyric\n\r
2004-07-25 03:35:39-07	3099	81	Quixadhal	Adventurers WANTED!	Over the years, many brave souls have set out from this bar.\n\rMany have died, some have wished they had died, and a very very\n\rfew became legends.  It has been a long time, do you think you\n\rcould become a legend?\n\r
2006-03-02 19:18:38-08	3099	82	Nomad	test	test\n\r
1993-02-03 14:23:32-08	3099	12	Kalamar	Comments	Why is it that when something as good as Wiley exists that it\n\rseems to receive more complaints than compliments?  Well, I for\n\rone would like to use this space to compliment Cyric and crew for\n\rthe wonderful work they have done on Wiley.  Over the past year\n\ror two they have been extremely open to player comments and have\n\rimplemented many player friendly options.  These include:  free\n\rrent, loss of exp. base on level and number of classes when you\n\rdie (a sliding scale), user friendly commands too numerous to\n\rname, and a host of other nice features.  They have strived to\n\rkeep Wiley both challenging and playable, and to pump out new\n\rareas as quickly as their free time will permit.  I think we owe\n\rit to these dedicated individuals to give them a little praise\n\rnow and then to help temper the number of grumbles and gripes\n\rthey receive.\n\r\n\rGood work guys!\n\r\n\rI'd like to apologize for my personal comments on me\n\rreimbursement which Harlequin remarked upon.  It was not my\n\rintention to sound demanding or derogitory (although it may have\n\rcome out to do a frustration born of problems which I created for\n\rmyself).  I will en- deavor in the futu to phrase my problems or\n\rinquiries in a less derogitory manner.\n\r\n\rKalamar\n\r
1993-02-03 19:09:59-08	3099	13	Cyric	kalamar	Thanks man, I think the wiley crew DID need that... :)\n\r
1993-02-06 13:14:08-08	3099	14	Cyric	New Stuff	I am holding off from introducing any new code into the server\n\rright now. I am not going to work on anything new until I find\n\rthe reason for the games spontaneous hanging and crashing.\n\r\n\rPlease keep the suggestions coming though, I do plan on putting\n\rin alot of new spells suggested by player, corwin, goodwind,\n\rnomad and many others, so keep sending them.\n\r\n\rCyric\n\r
1993-02-07 17:18:57-08	3099	15	Muth	Registering	As Cyric has stated before, once you are registered, you can\n\rnever be unregistered. Eli tells you this as well when he makes\n\rsure you are fully understood of what this means.\n\r\n\rSorry Aliya, once a killer, always a killer.\n\r
1993-02-08 13:29:25-08	3099	16	Velventhon	First let me say that this is	First let me say that this is the best mud I have been on.  I\n\rhave had a greaat time.  The only problem I have had is losing\n\rall my equipment when the game crashes.  Right now I am a 4/3\n\rFighter/Mage.  Powerfl enough that noone has pi crashes.  Leaving\n\rme to powerful to evoke pity and to week to reequip my- self.  My\n\ronly other problem is finding things.  When a more expierenced\n\rplayeris leading me somewhere they go to fast for me to learn the\n\rpath.  Thus I suggest selling maps to other locales:ie from\n\rvillage to goblins or village to Highstaff.

1993-02-09 02:08:41-08	3099	17	Muth	Items/Magical	I am glad to hear that the stronger items are more difficult to\n\rget, that is the why we invisioned it to be.  On the issue of\n\ritems losing power and/or becoming junk\n\rHow many suits of dragon scale armor do you think one can make\n\rfrom the hide of a dragon.  Surely your answer is a hell of a\n\rlot!  Yes, indeed you could make a hell of a lot, and indeed\n\rthere are now a hell of a lot in the game.  My response to this\n\rwas to make more in different places, on different mobs.  \n\rHave fun finding the new stuff!  8)\n\r\n\r<M>\n\r
1993-02-10 06:42:00-08	3099	18	Scruffy	To the creators of Greth and Highstaff.	Hi all!\n\r   First ... for greth could you please check into the experience\n\rgiven for slavers.  It seems disproportionate compared to the\n\ramount of damage they do.\n\r  Second... Can we tone down a few guards in highstaff?  One of\n\rthe reasons that you dont see more people staying there is that\n\rif you kill a youngster so she wont grow up into some goody goody\n\rand a guard comes by you get your backside smoked.  This chance\n\ris highly likely since the proportion of guards to people seems\n\rto be about 1 in 5.  I would make my home in Highstaff, but since\n\rI am usually running away from a Captain or Proud Guard I've\n\rtic'ed off it just isnt worth it.  Midguurd has the right idea\n\rsince the guards are fixed and the only other aggressives\n\r(starved men) are not large mobs.\n\r \n\r  Other questions... Is it possible for shops to be able to keep\n\rtheir inventory over reboots?  If I sell a set of steel banded\n\rbracers to the armourer and later get my current pair scrapped it\n\rwould be nice to be able to go back and by a pair that I had\n\rsold, but the inventory on every shop resets at reboot.\n\r  Also can you set a ceiling (other than available cash) for\n\ritems that shops will buy.  Someone comes in and sells a big item\n\rin the shops at shylar and poof he has no more cash for smaller\n\ritems.\n\r \n\r  Next... I've been through the jungles mapping and my first\n\rimpression is that they need a few more mobs.  Population density\n\rseems a bit low.  Also, is there any announced date for the\n\ropening of the city in the jungle? (the walled one).\n\r \n\r  My great Thx as always.\n\r    Scruffy\n\r
1993-02-10 12:25:21-08	3099	19	Muth	Scruffy	-= Will look into Gredth.\n\r-= Highstaff guards.  I will take a gander and see exactly what\n\r   the ratio is but you must remember, the reason the city is so\n\r   safe is because of the large number of guards.\n\r-= Elcid is in charge of the project of the City of Nesthar.  As\n\r   of yet he hasn't given me a finish date.  Sorry.\n\r\n\r<M>\n\r
1993-02-10 14:09:48-08	3099	20	Lightspeed	Hard but not fair?	Well this thing is bugging me a little first,I like this mud more\n\rthan others.\n\rBut better armor is only availible to higher levels like over 20\n\rsince people can charm Eli or stuff like that.I think that there\n\rshould be some way for level 8-13 to get some safe exp....because\n\rits just between those levels that peopl e stop playing their\n\rcharacters because they die too much.\n\rAgain i would like to say that this is a great mud but a little\n\rtoo hard.  So i would please get some better availible eq for\n\rlower levels?\n\rThe master of dying\n\rLightspeed\n\r
1993-02-10 15:23:48-08	3099	21	Jackal	Hermits . . . rehashed	I am here to beg mercy from the gods.  Remember the day when\n\rthe goblins invaded shylar and you guys left a prize?  I was the\n\rone who got the halberd.  I made it invisible so that If I got\n\rdisarmed I would be able to get it back, but today I lost it to a\n\rhermit who could apparently see invisible.  Can they all???  I\n\rknow the hermits are staying, and we've been through this subject\n\rbefore.  People say, 'Well, don't go to a screen with a hermit\n\rand start attacking.' It is kind of hard when an Aklan Guard just\n\rattacks you.\n\r  Please let me know if I can get my halberd back or if these\n\rwere your intensions for having hermits in the first place.\n\r       ----- Jackal\n\r

So could you please tell us if there is going to be\n\rone, or if there are not going to be any.  Thanks.\n\r\n\r-Emrys, that Genesis Listening, Mozart playing guy.\n\r
2006-03-02 19:19:01-08	3099	83	Nomad	Contact Info	I used to play this back in the day. Would be interested in what\n\rhappened over the times of ''95 till about now.

1993-02-11 05:30:47-08	3099	24	Scruffy	On Quests... From Uncle Scruffy	Hi\n\r   This is the information that I've gleaned on quests...  First\n\rof all there appear to be two types.  The first one seems to\n\rusually occur when a couple of the creators (gods, wizards) get\n\ronline and start giving out mysterious poems or clues to an\n\robjective which you must find.  Usually there is a deterrent to\n\ryou getting to this objective in the form of a monster standing\n\rthere waiting to eat your face.  The rewards for success are\n\rgreat for the gods are generous.  Weapons and armor of great\n\rpower and large (obscenely large for lower levels) amounts of\n\rexperience are the reward for success.\n\r  The second form of quests I must admit I have only heard in\n\rrumor and that takes the form of clues which are hidden in\n\rmysterious locations which lead you to further clues and so forth\n\runtil a goal is reached.\n\r  I have no experience as to what the rewards to be for the\n\rsecond, but I have been lucky enough to be one (and there are\n\rmore) of the winners of the first.\n\r  My advice is as follows, keep your eyes and ears open!  The\n\rgods on this world are mysterious and devious and quests can turn\n\rup in voices from nowhere, mystic notes, and billboards on\n\rtravellers road for all I know.\n\r   Scruffy.\n\r
1993-02-11 05:58:46-08	3099	25	Scruffy	Spell Durations changed?	Seems to me that the past two days my spells have had a LOT\n\rshorter duration.  Shield, Fly, Armor, Bless, and especially\n\rStrength are going away after 2 tics or so.  It was my\n\runderstanding that spells for multi-classes had returned to full\n\rstrength and duration. \n\r  Is the a wrong assumption, a bug, or something new?\n\r   Scruffy.\n\r
1993-02-11 06:31:51-08	3099	26	Scruffy	Uhmmm Muth? About Highstaff.	Uhmmm well gee, You see its like this.  If the city is safe with\n\rall the guards, it's also safe from us.  And while I really do\n\renjoy walking around the city and seeing all the great mobiles it\n\rwould be nice to be able to kill a few.  :)\n\r   Scruffy.\n\r
1993-02-11 19:50:34-08	3099	27	Jack	A funeral announcement...	It is with sad misfortune that I write this. My brother, Lan,\n\rranger of the woods, has passed into his next life. I was near\n\rwhen he fought the slavers of Gredth. He had vowed to destroy\n\revil, no matter what the cost would be. I have pledged to carry\n\ron his mission, to make shylar and all of the surronding realms\n\rsafe for its people. I ask you to join me in this mission, to\n\rmake the lands safe for it citizens. \n\rPlease honor my brother by joining me to reclaim this fair land.\n\r                                            Jack Al'Mandragorian\n\r

1993-02-12 17:37:37-08	3099	30	Kalamar	Comments	1. Charm monster still allows people to charm other registered\n\rAND non- registered characters.  Muidnar already knows about the\n\rproblem.\n\r2. Aliya,  I take offense at your statement that I'm trying to\n\rkiss up to the wiz's on Wiley.  After hearing several of the gods\n\rtalking about all the negative comments being thrown at them, I\n\rthought it might be nice to pay them a compliment or two.  I am\n\rusually one of the bigger complainers..er..critical observers\n\rmyself. :)\n\r3. I wholeheartedly agree with Drizzt about having the your spell\n\r(prac- tice) lists accessable when sleeping.  I see no reason\n\rthat a character who uses spells so frequently would not have a\n\rfew dreams about them.  :)\n\r\n\rKalamar\n\r

1993-02-15 03:22:47-08	3099	42	Aliya	IMPORTANT :GODS PLEASE READ!	Sorry about above...so anyway\n\rI was on killing ants with two other people. One got killed and\n\rended up back at the inn. We came to pick him up and an invisible\n\rsomeone was trying to get him to register. I said in general\n\rnever register. One of the guys I was with told the people to\n\rbugg off...because there were more than one trying to get him to\n\rregister.\n\rWell someone called him a jerk and I got upset and said "Bite me\n\ryou jerk!"\n\rWell Highlander thought that I was saying it to him when I was\n\rreally talking to the invis who was trying to get an innocent to\n\rregister!\n\rThat is how I got registered!\n\rSo anyway...he teleported me to somewhewre I never had even heard\n\rof before and I had to beg one guy to summon me to\n\rHighstaff...and another I had to pay a whole lot to summon me to\n\rthe inn...next to eli!\n\rI don't think registration should be so easey to do for one and\n\rtwo I think I am owed an apology from Highlander because he did\n\rthat and I didn't even do anything to him...I wasn't even talking\n\rto him to begin with!\n\rThat just REALLY PISSES ME OFF!\n\rAliya the really disgrunteled\n\rP.S.

I like the mud and would like to do more to help it\n\ralong.  I have experience with the online editing commands and\n\rthe role of immortality.  It would be an honor to be an immort on\n\rthis mud.  I have seen a few muds go down the drain because new\n\rareas were not being added in.  I would also like to help design\n\rsome of the other classes in the AD&D players handbook.\n\rPaladins, Druids and Bards would be a great addition to the game.\n\rFeel free to summon me at anytime.

1993-02-15 10:44:50-08	3099	47	Succubus	YOU BETTER READ THIS!	This MEANS YOU!  First I wanted to say what a fine Job is being\n\rdone here.  It encourages lots of people to spend lots of time\n\rplaying games.  GAME is the key word here.  I think that some\n\rthings here should be taken a little less seriously.  Some\n\rproblem could be ridden of if players would save.  I've played\n\rseveral diffent classes and characters on this mud, experiencing\n\rthe best of everything.  I've caused my share of trouble, and\n\rI've had more than my share of fun.  But what I was saying is\n\rthat I have NEVER EVER EVER lost anything in rent or because of a\n\rgame crash.  I've died SAVED and a crash occured.  I had all my\n\rstuff.  I've accidentally quit right before a crash.  Miraculusly\n\rgotten my stuff back, SAVED, then crash...I still had all my\n\rstuff.  As for Daisy, how could anyone and I do mean ANYONE, how\n\rcould anyone harbor any ill fealings towards such a wonderful\n\rwoman?  And I think it has been sufficiently brought up that\n\rregistering is a dangerous thing to do.  AND that it can't be\n\rreversed.  AND that even then Cyric and Co. have installed\n\rNOSUMMON and NOTELEPORT so People like Highlander can't teleport\n\ryou to a nasty place.  By the way, Nice try on me Highlander.\n\rWell, you all take care, and don't let the Demoness get you in\n\rthe night.\n\r*Succubus*\n\r
1993-02-15 12:11:03-08	3099	48	Baradakus	Agree with Succubus	I agree wholeheartedly with Succubus.  I've also played several\n\rcharacters and spent more than my share of time on this mud, and\n\rI've never had a problem with losing equipment.  Save is an\n\rimportant command, and it does work.  The gods have been more\n\rthan generous in installing safeguards to the game like no-\n\rsummon and registering; at some point characters have to start\n\rtaking responsibility for themselves (*grin*).  Thanks for a\n\rgreat mudding experience!\n\r                          BARADAKUS\n\r
1993-02-15 13:31:26-08	3099	49	Harlequin	My two cents....	And since I've got some weight around here, it's gonna be a BIG\n\rtwo cents....*snicker*...\n\rSAVE SAVE SAVE SAVE SAVE.  Succubus is right, the only way you\n\rcan lose your stuff around here is if you either A.) Don't save\n\rat all, or B.) you die and don't get a chance to save, i.e. the\n\rgame crashes as you die.  So save save save.  Get tintin and set\n\rup a macro to suto automatically save you at various points.  It\n\rreally helps.\n\r\n\rPalas: (and anyone else for that matter)  Just because you don't\n\rsee us on the who list, doesn't mean we are not on.  If someone\n\ris bugging you that way, just give a shout and we'll help you\n\rout.  Of course, just seeing a name like LouSucksPalasDick or\n\rsomething is grounds enough for us to kick the person off the\n\rgame....\n\rREGISTERING: Yes, we have warned time and time again that to\n\rregister leaves you open to much mischief, even Eli tells you\n\rthis before registering, and ultimately, the one responsible for\n\ryour actions in life is yourself.  If, after all the warnings,\n\ryou register, well...hey, we warned ya! \n\rFOREST: *cackle*\n\rHORSES etc.:  There are already mounts in the game, and I'm sure\n\rthat as soon as Cyric vanquishes the evil nasty bug that is\n\rmaking the game hang, stables and kennels will be forthcoming.\n\r
1993-02-15 13:39:29-08	3099	50	Harlequin	OH yeah...	About Highstaff.  I've seen many players of many classes make the\n\rtrip to highstaff with ease.  The trick to getting past the\n\rgiants and orcs?  Move REAL fast...*cackle*...Works for me!\n\r

You've probably\n\rnoticed lots of the changed commands/way-of-things (IE: darkness\n\routdoors).\n\r\n\rI tried to update the "info" command a bit... that might be helpful.\n\r\n\rGood to see ya back!\n\r
1996-02-14 21:44:20-08	3099	61	Quixadhal	RE:Scourge	Yup, afraid Scourge really does have that good of stats.  He's\n\ralways had good stats since the days of Wiley I, which was before\n\r*I* had ever seen it (I came into Wiley II).  Since he's had to\n\rrestart his character (which had progressed to level 50) at least\n\rtwice now, I don't see granting him his original stats as\n\ranything unusual.  By right, he should also have a keep and be\n\r50th level too.\n\r\n\rI would hope that you might expect a similar respect when whoever\n\rtakes over this place erects Wiley IX and you log into it as a\n\rnewbie.  I'd also hope the other players respected and feared you\n\ras one of the Ancients who Knows.\n\r

1996-02-26 12:12:15-08	3099	65	Quixadhal	NEW BUGS... er.. features!	Just to warn everyone... I did some recoding of things this\n\rmorning.  Experience is now handled differently for groups.... if\n\ryou are not grouped, or grouped only with yourself... you should\n\rget full exp for mobs (plus a 10% bonus for registered servents\n\rof Quixadhal!).  Groups of 2 or more will find the ratios changed\n\ra bit... I tried to make it fair to both multi-classers and\n\rsingles and NOT to lose too much exp in the division.  Let me\n\rknow how that works out.\n\r\n\rALSO:  You can now use "me" or "myself" to refer to yourself in\n\rmany commands.  And a few may have noticed that kill now comes\n\rBEFORE kiss <grin>...  Hope you all have fun!\n\r\n\r-Dread Quixadhal, Dark Lord of VI.\n\r
1996-02-28 10:25:20-08	3099	66	Quixadhal	NEW NEW NEW!	It's done!\n\r\n\rAll of you who buy pets, or use magical means to obtain your\n\rfaithful servants, REJOICE!\n\r\n\rIf you can keep the little critters alive, they will grow more\n\rpowerful as you do.  Gradually, they will follow you and become\n\reven better servants as they learn by watching your example.\n\r\n\rBURY COMMAND! (Quixadhal) Sun Mar  3 07:55:53 1996\n\rThis is important people!\n\r\n\rYou must now bury your dead!  If you do, you'll get a pleasant\n\rlittle exp bonus and become a little nicer.  If you don't...\n\rWell, you'll find out soon enough.  Let's say it won't be pretty.\n\r
1996-03-14 23:32:13-08	3099	67	owlbear	Exp	I've found exp is awfully hard to get for us mobs.\n\rOther mobs just aren't worth enough.\n\rI try to kill players, but they get pissed off and have their\n\rhigh-level friends hunt me down.\n\r
1996-03-14 23:41:50-08	3099	68	dragon	Mob disrespect	Yeah....if we mobs don't get respect, we're gonna start a UNION...\n\rThen we go on strike and all you get to kill is other players.\n\r\n\rRespect us or ELSE!!!\n\r
1996-03-28 02:56:46-08	3099	69	Suckling	YES!	Thank you Dread Lord!\n\r\n\rFor those of you who don't know... there is a new kick-ass\n\rcommand.\n\r\n\rDESECRATE!\n\r\n\rThis is the way to control the number of corpses that linger\n\rabout WITHOUT having to become a goody-two-shoes.\n\r\n\rMuahahahahahahahaha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\r
1996-06-09 23:43:02-07	3099	70	Rincewind	guilds	where are the guilds and how do you raise to the next level?. I\n\rfound the places where i can practise... but i don't know how to\n\radvance to the next level\n\r
1996-06-10 01:39:21-07	3099	71	Sedna	Guilds	It would be easy for me to give it away, but wouldn't it be\n\reasier to9 read the descriptions and find out for yourself?\n\r\n\rAll of the guildmasters are right here in Shylar.  Try entering\n\rthe prac and gain command to see what each one will do for you.\n\rI'll keep watching in case your online so I can help you out.\n\r\n\rSedna the grimy code devil\n\r
1996-06-10 18:39:15-07	3099	72	Rincewind	guilds..	oh... i found them alright... but i couldn't figure out how to\n\rraise levels.. as the gain command was not on the help...  you\n\rneed better help files on skills...\n\r\n\rand\n\r\n\rdoes your mastery of your skills increase each time you use it?\n\r
1996-06-13 15:20:01-07	3099	73	Sedna	gain	Apparently, it is not.  I'll ask Quixadhal to add the gain\n\rcommand to the help command list.  Also, the command ALLCOMMANDS\n\rwill give a list of all available commands available to players.  \n\r\n\rAnd, yes, your skill does increase to a certain level by use of\n\rthe skill.  Each time you cast a spell, use a fighting or\n\rstealing skill or use a weapon of a particular class, that skill\n\rgets better up to what is known as fair, I believe.  TO improve\n\rthe skill knowledge to master, you must practice it once or twice\n\rafter you get it to fair.\n\r
1996-08-18 22:21:33-07	3099	74	Fnord	my skills disappeared	I have lost all my skills.  I had the following skills\n\r\n\rtrack - superb\n\rapraise - superb\n\rpunch - very fair\n\rbarehand - very fair\n\r

Well.. where to start.. first off, I would love to know why the\n\rgods keep killing my character.. especially when there are only\n\rabout 3 people who even come around here anymore in the first\n\rplace. \n\r\n\rThis game used to be fun, I thought about finding a new mud.. but\n\rsimply decided to stay on this one because the interaction was\n\rnormaly good.. but oh well, I guess my friends and I simply find\n\ra new mud, no problem.\n\r

1993-01-22 18:37:11-08	5099	6	Emrys	bug/map inconsistency	right.  Okay, when you go 1 or 2 north from the outside of the\n\rgolden dragon then go east once you are put to the small area\n\rbehind the golden dragon.  the one you need to go east from\n\rinside the dragon to get to.\n\r
1993-01-22 18:38:39-08	5099	7	Emrys	bug	Dyou need to make this room like the back room.  No outside\n\rnoise.\n\r
1993-01-23 04:35:38-08	5099	8	Muth	RE: bug	That is no bug.  Do to our current exits available, there was no\n\rway to make that rooms exits logical.  You will have to read the\n\rdescriptions in that room to understand why those exits go where\n\rthey do.\n\r

1993-01-29 00:15:00-08	5099	15	Kalamar	Lost Equipment	Cyric,\n\rI was playing last night (Wed. the 27th) and the game crashed.\n\rWhen I logged on today (28th) I found that I had lost all of my\n\requipment.  I was wondering if a reimbursement would be possible.\n\rIt sounded like quite a few other people had lost their equipment\n\rtoo.\n\rKalamar\n\r
1993-01-30 18:42:28-08	5099	16	Ender	stats	My stats (str, dex, etc) really kinda suck. This is NOT just\n\ranother whiney note. I was thinking thaat perhaps one could use\n\rpractices to increase one's stats. This is not entirely without\n\rbasis.  One could prctice "wieghtlifting" or some equivalent\n\rskill to increase strength instesd of practicing the latest\n\rfighting techniques.  One could read and study to increase\n\rknowledge(Wisdom), or practice juggling to increase dexterity.\n\rSkills like this would allow those of us born with low stats a\n\rchance to improve them without handing out stat increases\n\rindescriminately, or upsetting the "game balance" by having loads\n\rof characters running around with perfect stats, or if they did\n\rthey would hav no spells or other skills and so balance out the\n\rcharacter that way.\n\rJust my 2 cents.\n\r\n\r-ender(the good)\n\r
1993-01-30 18:51:27-08	5099	17	Melanie	The Customs House	On my way around the city trying to find the Mage's Guild, I\n\rwandered into the Custom's House.  I have a question about the\n\rcontents.....or two.\n\r#1 The map is a gype.\n\r#2 what does the paper and badges do???\n\rCan someone say???-Melanie the good.\n\r (unless you are a Wealthy or young lass snuggling me)\n\r
1993-01-30 23:07:07-08	5099	18	Highlander	Map	Gee Melanie, My map of Highstaff is perfect, maybe you need glasses or\n\rsomething? <grin>\n\r\n\r        Highlander, the not so good!\n\r
1993-01-31 16:54:05-08	5099	19	Melanie	MAP	Not when it says that I was gyped the map is so decayed that I\n\rcouldn't read it!!!!!!!\n\r\n\rMelanie The Good\n\r
1993-01-31 19:40:53-08	5099	20	Orris	20	I agree with ender -- There are ways for a person to increase his\n\rstrength, dexterity but maybe not so much constitution and\n\rintelligence.  If widsom is common sense then there are certain\n\rthings that could be done to raise that also.\n\r  Morgan of Orris\n\r
1993-02-02 16:10:13-08	5099	21	Kalamar	Stats	There are already objects in the game that allow you to raise\n\ryour stats.  I think what you guys are looking for are new stats\n\raltogether.  I have a suggestion.  I've noticed that on several\n\rother muds that once a char- acter reaches a certain level\n\r(usually 5th) they have a place they can go to redistribute or\n\rreroll their statistics.  The Forgotten Realms mud eastablishes\n\rbase stats (8 for all) and allows you to add extra points from a\n\rpool on to any stat you wish.  I think they limit the change to\n\ronly once or twice per character.  I realize that this would take\n\ra while to implement, but I thought I'd throw the idea out for\n\rdiscussion.\n\r\n\rKalamar\n\r

1993-02-04 20:54:38-08	5099	22	Swift	An Important Suggestion	Swift, the amazing first level thief here!\n\r\n\r     I would like to make a suggestion...  I thinks that it would\n\rbe great if someone could install an autosave function, so that\n\rwhenever anyone dies, they are automatically saved...  I have\n\rpersonally lost all my equipment six times, and I believe that\n\rthis detracts a bit from the gaming atmosphere.  Would an\n\rautosave help this?  I've played on other MUDs with such a\n\rfeature, and it worked quite well.\n\r\n\r                                     Just my thoughts,\n\r                                     Swift, the thief\n\r

1993-02-10 18:52:52-08	5099	25	Thrym	RE:title	Well, I think that asking for such a title sort of implies that\n\rit would not really fit well.  <snicker>\n\rThink about it.\n\r                  -Thrym the Untitled One.\n\r
1993-02-10 21:54:01-08	5099	26	Ender	Stats II	Well,  yes i  kinda want  new  stats, and   i  like  the  idea\n\rof   being able   to reroll,  but I   am  willing to spend\n\rpractice  sessinonsto  iimprove stats,  or   most  any  other\n\rcost/quest/effort  the  gods  see   fit.  I agree that   there\n\rare  objects to  raiise   stats,   but  when  stats  suck  as\n\rbadly as mine  (5 con,  8  str  9  wis  11 dex  and  14  wis)\n\rthe  objects (except  for  tiera)  don't   really help  worth\n\rmentionioning.  (sorry for   the extra  spacing,  but  ths\n\rkeyboard  is  really  funky toniite)\n\rEnder  the usually  good.\n\r
1993-02-11 12:54:38-08	5099	27	Krinn	stats III	well Ender if you will recall in D&D there is such a thing as Max\n\rlevel which is based on races and according to abilities, i dont\n\rthink the code here has been written for that but maybee it just\n\rfal into place that the higher you get with such low stats the\n\rless you actually increase power. my suggestion would be retire\n\rand start again, looking at your stats i would guarantee better\n\rrolls, and you will have equpment to 'hand down' to your new guy\n\rto make low levels easier to obtain and in no time youll be back\n\rwhere you are and better than before\n\r\n\rthoughts from Krinn - a traveler from Kolyema\n\r
1993-02-11 13:16:20-08	5099	28	Krinn	WOW	Bravo Muth! awesome new area tha temple drenth is really cool\n\rabout time we had an area that requiered as much thought as it\n\rdoes strength!(not that all the areas arent cool) this just\n\rhappens to be my favorite so far anyway excelent job!

Great diversity....\n\r\n\r2) The guards in midgaard seem to have a problem?  After i kill\n\r   the one at the gate, the square and the one at the temple, they\n\r   regenerate at the alter....????  Why is that?  5 guards at once\n\r   is even a challenge to Corwin, let alone me??\n\r\n\rThanks,\n\r    Goodwind of Loucks\n\r
1993-02-13 16:58:52-08	5099	34	Muth	Aklan guards	I will fix that...sorry.\n\r
1993-02-13 17:15:28-08	5099	35	Muth	Goodwind...	We are fully aware of the charm monster bug everyone.  Until\n\rCyric is able to fix the hanging/crashing server it won't be\n\rfixed.\n\r\n\r  Goodwind: Stop abusing this bug.  If your actions continue I\n\r            will personally deal with you in a appropriate\n\r            fashion.\n\r<M>\n\r
1993-02-13 20:42:26-08	5099	36	Jackal	Orc Guards	Muth,\n\r   The orc guards have a similar problem.\n\r\n\rLord Jackal of Orris -- A being who goes where he doesn't belong.\n\r
1993-02-14 04:53:48-08	5099	37	Muth	Orc guards	They should be more spread now...\n\r<M>\n\r
1993-02-14 16:35:10-08	5099	38	Jackal	Some thoughts	Scrolls --\n\r  They are much better now that they have titles on them.  Could\n\rthose of us with spell craft, or who already know the spell on\n\rthe scroll understand those cryptic titles?\n\r\n\rStrength spell --\n\r  Why can't fighter mages or even mages alone get 18 with bonuses\n\rfrom the strength spell?  I have an 18 strength without the spell\n\rand there are still some weapons, a heavy hammer for example,\n\rthat I am unable to wield.  Does the spell help fighters with an\n\r18 (50) strength?\n\r
1993-02-14 18:22:19-08	5099	39	Goodwind	Blacksmith...	There seems to be a problem with the blacksmith.  Whenever He\n\rfixes armor, he decreases the value by one.  On apraise it says:\n\r   effective : [4]\n\r   when repaired: [5]\n\r\n\rBut when i get it repaired, It goes down to [4]. Why is this?...\n\r\n\rAnd if it supposed to be like this, why did you take away our\n\rsupply to Isha's armor?  Now it will never be the same........\n\r\n\rGoodwind of Loucks\n\r
1993-02-14 20:27:11-08	5099	40	Krinn	some thoughts and answers	- i like the scroll idea jackal has\n\r- goodwind not even a blacksmith can make armor last forever\n\r- it was allready explained to us why isha has no more dragon\n\r  scale\n\r- there is more dragon scale in the game we havenet found it (so\n\r  i was told)\n\r\n\r- can we get our prac lists during sleep? woul dbe a major help\n\r- muth the orc guards are stil in the same place, and warriors\n\r  still all regen in same room\n\r- this is th most awesome mud ive ever played!\n\r- ill never play another!\n\r- nifty new area, Muidnar! pretty tough\n\r\n\r- Krinn the traveler from kolyema who has found his new home in\n\r  highstaff!\n\r
1993-02-14 20:36:32-08	5099	41	Wulfgar	harlequin	Harlequin....I have lost feathered armplates, small leather\n\rpouch, hawk staff and 18 cassoroles. please help\n\r
1993-02-14 20:38:02-08	5099	42	Wulfgar	harlequin	I also lost black chain vest and black chain leggins thank-you!!!\n\r
1993-02-15 12:38:45-08	5099	44	Muth	Orcs...	What orcs are you talking about?  The cave with four orc guards\n\rat the entrance has been fixed...pehaps you are speaking of\n\ranother cave?\n\r<M>\n\r
1993-02-15 14:13:17-08	5099	45	Jefe	lewer	hello. honey. are you surprised? You must have been playing with\n\rthis character cuz he has a bunch of stuff. How are you?\n\r
1996-02-28 02:59:59-08	5099	46	Quixadhal	ADMIN: GAP	There appears to be a gap in the board file records here.\n\rSome weeks were lost.\n\r
1996-02-28 10:28:36-08	5099	47	Quixadhal	NEW NEW NEW	It's done!\n\r\n\rAll of you who buy pets, or use magical means to obtain your\n\rfaithful servants, REJOICE!\n\r\n\rIf you can keep the little critters alive, they will grow more\n\rpowerful as you do.  Gradually, they will follow you and become\n\reven better servants as they learn by watching your example.\n\r
1996-03-03 10:57:55-08	5099	48	Quixadhal	RE: levels	Yup.  Sorry about that, but you must admit the old exp tables\n\rwere horribly unfair.  Once you hit level 20+ it became trivial\n\rto go up in levels, which tells ME that either it shouldn't be so\n\reasy, or we should go back to only having 20 levels.  IE:  If the\n\rlevels aren't hard to get, they don't mean much... and if they\n\rdon't mean much, why bother?\n\r\n\rSo, I apologize to the few high level people who will feel hurt\n\rby this, but look at it this way... as long as you don't get\n\rlevel drained, you're WAY ahead of everyone else!\n\r
1996-03-03 18:29:58-08	5099	49	Dorn	dead	The new undea thing is cool.\n\rI love it\n\rif a newibe is killing chickens, ya can bury them...  even if\n\ryou're in HS or greth or something.... *giggle* and I'd just like\n\rto announce that... I'll probably not be burying the corpses.....\n\r:likes killing undead.\n\r
1996-03-04 06:27:21-08	5099	50	Puck	40	Hmmm... I agree with the new level tables... they are far more\n\rright than they were.  Except that between 14th-20th theres not\n\rmany good places to get experience on your own.  (God only knows\n\rhow mnay times I leveled the stands).\n\r\n\rBut really, these levels are pretty worthless for me.  I haven't\n\rgained a new spell or skill since 16th, and I'm 22nd now!  Its \n\rgetting dull.\n\r\n\rand the undead thing is okay, but it kinda sucks... burying every\n\rcorpse is time-consuming...  but thats a god's decision...\n\r\n\ranyhow... add new ranger spells.\n\r\n\rPuck\n\r
1996-03-04 12:28:14-08	5099	51	Dorn	exp	Gee, I have to agree with storm and puck.\n\rHmmm.... The new level tables are slick.\n\rI like working to advance.\n\rI don't like starting over when I die.\n\rSee, I died and suddenly needed like 4.2 million to advance.\n\rNow, I am  31st level, so it's coming back, but I'm also \n\rlogged in for like 30 hours a week.  and 30 hours is a lot \n\rto advance.\n\r\n\rThe Paliadin \n\rP.S. My mana Regain hasn't changed since 20th.  Is that like\n\rthe level tables?  Has no-one thought of that?\n\r
1996-03-11 03:01:54-08	5099	52	Sedna	Rules of the game	Hello, players.\n\r\n\rIt has always been the policy of WileyMUD in the past to allow\n\ronly one playing character per person.  The rule is somewhat\n\rrelaxed, but the Gods consider the simultaneous use of characters\n\rby one person to be EVIL.  Such players are warned against using\n\rtwo characters, lest the wrath of the gods might be visited upon\n\rthe offenders.\n\r\n\rIf you have any questions, please post them to this board and I\n\rwill attempt to clarify the policy.\n\r\n\rThanks\n\r\n\r-Sedna\n\r
1996-03-11 19:21:42-08	5099	53	Dorn	Appraise	So, I was feeling like there autta be SOME way to tell if a\n\rweapon is damaged.  I figured that perhaps apraise autta give a\n\rhint.  But I still feel like apraise might also mention something\n\rabout the damage roll.\n\r
1996-03-11 20:36:54-08	5099	54	Sedna	Appraising	What I see when I appraise an item is the statements:\n\rIt is very well balance.\n\rand\n\rIt has definite magical properties.\n\rGranted, it doesn't give hit/dam scores or such, but is a good\n\rindicator of the damage level of the weapon and it's current\n\rcondition.  I will look into this further to see if I can improve\n\rit.\n\r\n\r-Sedna\n\r
1996-03-11 23:14:43-08	5099	55	Dorn	RE: apr by sedna	No it isn't.  Those descriptions are about the Majikal proporties\n\ronly.\n\r
1996-03-12 02:55:19-08	5099	56	Sedna	Puck, stop complaining.	You have a new spell.  Check it out.\n\r
1996-03-13 16:08:31-08	5099	57	Muidnar	PwD	Wow.... My password is "false"\n\rBelive me?\n\rTry it out and see.\n\r
1996-03-14 03:10:09-08	5099	58	Sedna	Muidnar	It won't do any good, of course....Muidnar is level 1 now....\n\r\n\rThe Dark One has fallen!!!\n\r
1996-03-18 06:25:00-08	5099	59	Edge	ACandSuch	ok, so im lucky enough to have my ac at 0 with eq and no spells,\n\rdont call me greedy but when i equip my shield that is 15ac i\n\rwould think that my ac would drop to -1 at least. Am i wrong? or\n\ris there a limit to AC that can be gained by eq?\n\r\n\rAlso, in an effort to try different things, i am lowering my\n\ralign to try different eq and cant see to lower my alignment\n\ranymore.  I was told that bury makes you better so i stopped\n\rburying and tried to get and junk them or give them to hermit.\n\rThis isnt working.  I am killing good citizens of\n\rhighstaff,doves,young lasses, its not working.  Perhaps something\n\ris wrong with this Pfile, i dont know.\n\r\n\rQuix made some doves for me once, and that worked, but it hasnt changed since.\n\r
1996-03-18 21:36:29-08	5099	60	Puck	Pouting	Stop your pouting, edge.  Go to shylar, slay all the villagers\n\rand let them become demons to kill the newbies.\n\r\n\rGo after the pegasuses in the mountains.  Avoid killing thieves,\n\rgypsies, seedy boys, gamesman, drenth, slaadi, mountain giants,\n\retc.\n\r\n\rDon't bury anything, and don't kill the undead that come from\n\rthat, if possible.\n\r\n\rHopefully there will be a nice area for you to become evil in\n\rsoon.  Its much easier to make experience being good.\n\r\n\rPuck the All-Good.\n\r
1996-04-18 22:26:50-07	5099	61	Storm	poison	I got a question about the poison spell, cause i tried to cast it\n\ron a weapon, one magical and another nonmagical.  Each one i\n\rtried to detect poison on it and also on myself and non of those\n\rtold me if the object was actually poisoned.  Shouldnt detect\n\rpoison and the poison work on objects in the way that i used em?\n\rcould some one look at it? and is the poison permanent on\n\robjects? or what?\n\r\n\rhey, thanks again\n\r\n\r>======------->Storm,  the soon to be employed\n\r
1996-06-13 15:23:59-07	5099	62	Sedna	poison	I don't believe poison works on weapons.  That is a neat idea,\n\rthough.  I cast poison on a weapon and ran stat on it and nothing\n\rchanged.\n\r
1996-07-14 00:22:27-07	5099	63	Questor	undead	I don't think it's fair that undead roam shylar and highstaff and\n\rthink I should get my weapons and xp back.\n\r\n\rquestor\n\r
1996-07-14 00:26:19-07	5099	64	Questor	unfair	this game has become very unfair.\n\r\n\rIt's no wonder noone wants to play anymore.\n\r
1996-07-22 03:00:54-07	5099	65	Quixadhal	RE: unfair	The only reason it's unfair is that nobody is playing.  The\n\rfeatures I've added to make the game more challenging assume a\n\rsmalish-normal playerbase of about 10-20 people online at any\n\rgiven moment.  As you see, with only 1 or 2, it becomes MUCH\n\rharder.\n\r\n\rWiley has *ALWAYS* been designed around people grouping together\n\rinstead of wandering around solo... yes, you could do it solo...\n\rbut it was DAMN hard!\n\r\n\rMy suggestion would be to try and convince a few friends to give\n\rthe place a chance and join up with you.  I haven't gone out of\n\rmy way to advertise the place because, frankly, I don't think\n\rit's out of beta-testing yet.  I think you'll find that if we get\n\rsomeone dedicated to runing the place full-time (IE:  not a coder\n\rlike me... a real IMM with no other side-projects to distract\n\rhim/her), and a few dozen players, the game will be a hell of\n\ralot of fun.\n\r\n\rFYI:  My last goal in coding this thing is to finish divorcing\n\rthe data files from their hard-coded state so future imms can\n\rexpand this thing easily.  If I ever get the chance to finish\n\rthat, I'll be more than happy to look around for anyone wanting\n\rto really run this game as a game instead of a test-bed.\n\r\n\rCheers!                             -Dread Quixadhal.\n\r
1996-11-18 20:15:22-08	5099	66	Suuphi	Players	How come nobody else EVER plays here?\n\r\n\rIt's not that bad.... *sigh*\n\r
1999-03-30 19:29:42-08	5099	67	Quixadhal	The Land is Dead.	Greetings, to any who might wander in this forsaken land.\n\rThrought years of neglect, mismanagement, and battling egos, the\n\rworld has faded into obsucurity and dust.\n\r\n\rIt shall never be as it once was, but perhaps I can take a little\n\rbit of it with me to another place.\n\r\n\rFarewell.\n\r
2004-07-25 03:38:12-07	5099	68	Quixadhal	At last!	At last, you have come!  Long years have passed since anyone\n\rhas arrived from the hamlet of Shylar... we had believed the\n\rmountains were closed.  But you are here!  There may be hope\n\rfor us yet!\n\r
2020-08-09 06:30:44.12666-07	3099	99	Newnomad	Happy 2020	Happy 2020\r\n

A high priest of Tyken had his last day as he\r\n    prayed for the spell and transported himself and a small party to a\r\n    location known only to him, he did not unfortunatly return.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   None\r\n    Damage:     None\r\n    Special:    Only rooms that will allow you entrance as per magic can\r\n                be walked to.\r\n

It is known that a higher\r\n    level mages magical armor will hold its consistancy much longer than\r\n    one of lower level.\r\n\r\n    The prayer for this spell seems to work much the same as several\r\n    priests and mages have consulted and tested upon it.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   Level of the Best Magic Class. See NOTE.\r\n    Damage:     None\r\n    Special:    AC is reduced by 2.  Note, this may not be shown by what\r\n                is on your score. Internally the AC is done by -100 <->\r\n                100, not -10 <-> 10 so rounding does occur for the the\r\n                score command. But it is a good approximation as to your\r\n                AC.\r\n    NOTE:       Since this is a shared spell between mages and clerics,\r\n                the duration is calculated as per the best level of the\r\n                two.

Clerics will find being extremely good will allow them to heal\r\n    the appropriate amount while being evil will allow the cleric to harm\r\n    targets quite well, yet they will suffer in their healing abilities.\r\n    Please do not be dismayed about not seeing a entire spell list, simply\r\n    ask those that are of higher levels if your curiousity gets the best\r\n    of you.\r\n\r\n    One can find out more about spells by 'help <spell>', if the reply\r\n    comes back not in the help files please 'bug <spell name>'.\r\n\r\n    Cyric and staff have taken great aims to make the spells in Wiley as\r\n    close to the spells on would find in any players handbook for AD&D.\r\n    If you find that a spell is totally different than one you would find\r\n    within, please 'bug <problem>'.\r\n\r\n    More spells are being added constantly for all magic-using classes, if\r\n    you would like to see a unusual spell use the 'idea <spell>' to add it\r\n    to our possibilities.\r\n

It has\r\n                been said that those clerics true to their faith have been\r\n                able to heal more then this meager amount.\r\n

Those that follow the path of light often find this intricate\r\n    prayer hard to pronounce, finding the target not suffering the full\r\n    damage of this spell.  It is known a high priest of Aklan has cast\r\n    this prayer upon a follower stealing his life from him on the stop not\r\n    even giving it a second thought.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   None\r\n    Damage:     3d8 + 3\r\n    Special:    None\r\n

Those who find themselves following a lighter\r\n    path through life find the spell lasting longer, allowing them to see\r\n    more of there eternal foes.  Several high mages have been\r\n    experimenting with this spell trying to get many different colors\r\n    beyond those which the spells calls upon.\r\n\r\n    The prayer is very similar to the incantation although the faith of\r\n    the caster is much more dependant upon how long the spell allows you\r\n    to see those of evil.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   20 hrs\r\n    Damage:     None\r\n    Special:    Those of a good alignment have been able to sustain this\r\n                spell for days on end...\r\n

For, this spell takes the power from the mage and places it\r\n    within the item casted upon.

Followers have been commonly\r\n    seen casting this spell on someone walking the bazaar, for no reason\r\n    other than seeing the pain in anothers eye.\r\n\r\n    Those of a light path find this spell difficult to cast, the words of\r\n    the prayer evading the caster, the spell doing much less damage.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   None\r\n    Damage:     1d8\r\n    Special:    None\r\n

When\r\n    mounted, you lose no movement points, except for those in combat, you\r\n    have some spell capabilities, and some skills will not be usable when\r\n    mounted, the same will apply towards some skills that are not usable\r\n    to a person when mounted.  You do not have control of the beast to the\r\n    point of being able to issue orders to it, you may however simply type\r\n    the direction you wish to travel and the mount shall carry you there.\r\n\r\n    This is still experimental, all bug reports are welcome and encourged\r\n    to help get this ironed out as fast as possible.

The tutor in various towns can teach you these skills\r\n    and perhaps even commoners you may adventure to find.\r\n\r\n    Skills have been broken up into two categories.\r\n\r\n    1.  Passive\r\n    2.  Active\r\n\r\n    Passive skills are those that are always being used without you having\r\n    to issue a specific command to make them act on you or another.\r\n    Various rolls are made against your knowledge of the skills to see if\r\n    they aid you in what every action you are taking.  Never will a skill\r\n    hinder you if you fail a roll, the most you can expect is that the\r\n    normal affects will take place as if you never had the skill at all. \r\n\r\n    Active skills are those that you must invoke on your own.  These\r\n    skills are activated by using the skill name and usually including an\r\n    arguement for the skill to act on.\r\n\r\n    SEE ALSO:   ACTIVE, PASSIVE for skill lists.\r\n

They are allowed to practice several effective combat\r\n    tactics including kick, bash, rescue, and disarm.  Warriors of higher\r\n    levels also see the benefit of multiple attacks.\r\n\r\n    SEE ALSO: PRACTICE\r\n

2023-07-25 15:51:55.177009-07	f	SYSTEM	53	RACES\r\n    Monsters belong to races, as do you.  Some races do not get along or\r\n    have natural enemies, so beware!\r\n\r\n    Races that players can be include:\r\n        Human, Elven, Gnome, Dwarven, and Halfling\r\n\r\n    SEE ALSO: HUMAN, ELF, GNOME, DWARF, HALFLING\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.211482-07	f	SYSTEM	60	SNEAK\r\n    Thieves and Rangers Only.\r\n\r\n    Used for sneaking (moving in and out of rooms without anyone taking\r\n    notice).  When you type sneak, there is no way to know if you actually\r\n    sneak. If you successfully sneak, then you will continue to sneak for\r\n    a little while. When you are sneaking, many monsters that would\r\n    otherwise attack you will not notice you, allowing you to go places\r\n    that no others can get to without encountering a battle on the way.\r\n\r\n    Example:\r\n        > sneak\r\n        You'll try to move silently for a while. \r\n\r\n    Thieves SEE ALSO: HIDE, BACKSTAB, STEAL, PICK\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.571833-07	f	SYSTEM	141	CURE SERIOUS\r\n    This prayer, more intricate than cure light follows the others path\r\n    in, it would seem, the same way.  Those that are true of heart seem to\r\n    be able to cure the worst wound, while others find that the prayer\r\n    comes with difficulty and can not recieve the full extent.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   None\r\n    Damage:     None\r\n    Special:    A cleric can give upto 2d8+2 points back in health.\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.623522-07	f	SYSTEM	152	HEAL\r\n    This prayer calls upon the diety to heal all wounds that would ail the\r\n    target of the spell.  This spell is recieved by all that have gained\r\n    the power to cast yet those that are true to virtue find the very\r\n    difficult prayers of this spell to flow from their lips healing all\r\n    that may ail someone.  Others, especially those that follow a dimmer\r\n    path find the spell heals, yet the true power is just out of their\r\n    reach.  The dark of heart can heal yet the true meaning of the spell\r\n    evades them.  It is known that a high priest of Tyken has healed even\r\n    the laim to full health, allowing them to lead a fullfilled life,\r\n    having been touched by a diety.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   None\r\n    Damage:     Special\r\n    Special:    Those with the evil out look on life will do less healing\r\n                then those seeking a life of virtue and goodness.  The\r\n                same is mirrored with that of Harm.  A truely holy cleric\r\n                could take a fighter up to full while others may only\r\n                heal twice of what their level is.\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.271075-07	f	SYSTEM	73	WIELD\r\n    When you get tired of bashing monsters with your fists, you might\r\n    consider wielding a weapon. \r\n\r\n    Example: \r\n        > wield sword\r\n        > wield two sword           - for wielding it two handed\r\n\r\n    NOTE: some weapons require you to wield them two handed.\r\n\r\n    See also: REMOVE, EQUIPMENT\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.501784-07	f	SYSTEM	125	GROUP\r\n    Usage: GROUP [player]\r\n\r\n    If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for\r\n    killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only\r\n    be shared among group members that are in the same location, at the\r\n    time of the killing blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group\r\n    members have been participating in the fight.\r\n\r\n    Group with no argument show a list of people with whom you are\r\n    grouped.\r\n\r\n    To make a group, a leader must be selected. All members of the group\r\n    must then follow the leader using the follow command. The leader\r\n    should NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group\r\n    membership for each player in the group, by using group <player_name>.\r\n    The leader should remember to include himself in the group.\r\n\r\n    Example:\r\n        Cyric and Muth wish to group with Grimwell.\r\n\r\n        Cyric:      > follow grimwell\r\n        Muth:       > follow grimwell \r\n        (grimwell should be following no one but himself)\r\n        grimwell:   > group grimwell\r\n        grimwell:   > group cyric\r\n        grimwell:   > group muth\r\n\r\n        Later when grimwell gets upset at muth (because he is sleeping\r\n        all the time) he types: \r\n\r\n        grimwell:   > group muth\r\n\r\n        to kick Muth out of the group.\r\n\r\n    SEE ALSO: XP EXPERIENCE\r\n

2023-07-25 15:51:55.630958-07	f	SYSTEM	154	LOCATE OBJECT\r\n    This prayer helps the caster find a object that he knows the exact\r\n    name of.  It must be something close to the caster or well known to\r\n    him at the least, for finding this object somewhere across the realm\r\n    is a ardous and long task.  Some have noted that this spell cast only\r\n    once has taken days in the process.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   None\r\n    Damage:     None\r\n    Special:    None\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.359342-07	f	SYSTEM	94	THIEF\r\n    Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other class\r\n    offers.  Many of these qualities can come in handy in many situations,\r\n    such as picking locks.  They are not very combat oriented, however, so\r\n    do not expect to be able to kill many things by yourself.  The useful\r\n    aspect of thieves involves their ability to scout ahead, avoiding\r\n    monsters, detecting and removing traps and selling and buying items at\r\n    the black market.\r\n\r\n    You can improve you skills by using the practice command.\r\n\r\n    SEE ALSO: PRACTICE\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.380226-07	f	SYSTEM	98	PRACTICE\r\n    Practice is the way you improve your spells and skills. You must go to\r\n    your guildmaster to let him/her help you improve.  If you type\r\n    practice, you will see which skills you can improve upon, and how good\r\n    you already are at these.  You can then use practice <skill>, to\r\n    practice the appropriate skill.  You can only practice a certain\r\n    amount for each level you gain, and you do not have to save this, it\r\n    can be accumulated.  When you go out and begin to use this new skill\r\n    you will begin to understand what it is you have just learned. In\r\n    essence you will improve you ability to do use this skill.  This will\r\n    allow you to become an average user of the skill.  To improve further\r\n    you must go back and have someone (guildmaster) teach you the\r\n    subtlties of the skill you are using.\r\n\r\n    The number of practices you recieve is based on the class you are and\r\n    the prime ability for that class.  A fighter is strength for example.\r\n    This is not the only factor in gaining practices, it is also based on\r\n    the NEW things you have done to gain exp.\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.627741-07	f	SYSTEM	153	INVISIBILITY\r\n    This incantation allows the target the spell to step into a paralel\r\n    realm that has been reported to be much different than our own.\r\n    Although this realm has only been seen by one, whom the spell seems to\r\n    have misfired slightly, is claimed to exit, none but the one can\r\n    varify.  On the usual this spell allows the target to slip into a form\r\n    of non-reality in which very few things can see.  You in fact become\r\n    unseeable to normal eyes allowing one to more freely within many\r\n    hostile realms.  It is commonly noted that attacking another while in\r\n    this state will immediately cause one to become visible again.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   1hr + (level/2)\r\n    Damage:     None\r\n    Special:    This is nullified if combat is entered, and a person is\r\n                rendered visible to those that can see into other plains\r\n                of existance.\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.742503-07	f	SYSTEM	179	FIREBALL\r\n    Area Affect Spell\r\n\r\n    The draining and long incantation of this spell brings forth a small,\r\n    but gaining sphere of elemental fire.  Upon contact with the\r\n    disignated taget the sphere explodes contacting with everything in the\r\n    mages immediate area, only the caster is naturally immune to the\r\n    destructive effects of this dangerous spell.  Many mages in the\r\n    Quintelan house have been trying to negate those that travel with them\r\n    but have only ended up with charred corpses.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   None\r\n    Damage:     (Level/5)d6 + 2d6 worth of damage.\r\n    Special:    Objects carried by creatures will also suffer damage.\r\n                A 50th level mage does 12d6 worth of damage to area of\r\n                affect.\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.455969-07	f	SYSTEM	115	FOLLOW\r\n    If you happen to be going in the same direction as someone else, why\r\n    not simply follow that person? For example: Follow joe. If you are\r\n    following someone and you wish to stop doing that, then all you have\r\n    to do is follow yourself: follow <your name>.\r\n\r\n    SEE ALSO: GTELL, GROUP\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.461414-07	f	SYSTEM	116	FLEE\r\n    If you are in a fight and things are beginning to get a little\r\n    uncomfortable (maybe you are about to die), just type "flee", and\r\n    presto!  you are out of harm's way - that is, IF you are still\r\n    standing and, IF there is a suitable exit nearby, and IF that exit\r\n    does not simply take you out of the frying pan and into the fire...\r\n    but then, who wants to live forever?\r\n\r\n    Fleeing is also a sudden and unexpected thing to do, so if you have\r\n    anyone following you that you'd like to lose, this may work in your\r\n    favor!\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.739271-07	f	SYSTEM	178	ENERGY DRAIN\r\n    This incantation is the most draining a mage can cast.  With this\r\n    spell one must put forth part of his life energy to draw forth part of\r\n    the targets life energy, then with the succesful completetion of the\r\n    spell both forces are drawn back to the caster, gaining the benefits\r\n    of both.  A Quintelan renegade mage had quite a lot of luck draining\r\n    the life of another and himself being advanced quickly until his luck\r\n    ran out, tis rumored the spell turned on him and he was consumed in\r\n    his own greed for power.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   None\r\n    Damage:     Very Very Evil, only those with the blackest of hearts\r\n                will find out its secrets through use....\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.560941-07	f	SYSTEM	138	CREATE WATER\r\n    Brings water forth into a container. The container must be clean and\r\n    one that has already contained the purest water that will refill it.\r\n    Strange side affects have been known to happen to those that do not\r\n    prepare their receptical beforehand.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   None\r\n    Damage:     None\r\n    Special:    A container can be filled to the top with this spell.\r\n

A player with\r\n                this skill has the chance of reviving a fallen comrade in\r\n                battle by applying knowledge learned through practice.\r\n                This skill is a must for those that do not have the god\r\n                given powers of healing.\r\n\r\n    Track:      SEE TRACK\r\n\r\n    Punch:      Bare knuckle brawling is the best type of fun any can\r\n                find!  Punch aids those that can not seem to hang onto\r\n                their weapon in battle, or those that do not wish to wield\r\n                a weapon at all.  The skill bare hand aids in this\r\n                offensive skill greatly along with any str bonus that\r\n                might be applied.  Those that wear gloves of some sort\r\n                have been known to knock an opponent down to his knees,\r\n                only to never see the light of day.\r\n\r\n    Apraise:    This skill give minor information on an object that is\r\n                either a weapon, armor, or light source.  Message\r\n                depicting the relative value of the object and information\r\n                that is unique to each object.  Apraise on a weapon will\r\n                give its weapon class, for the fighters that can\r\n                specialize in that class.  For a torch, it will give the\r\n                hours left to burn.  On armor, it will show the Effective\r\n                and True Armor class of the object.  If the True and\r\n                Effective armor classes are not the same, it is time to\r\n                get the armor repaired.  This can also be done by just\r\n                looking at the armor.\r\n\r\n    DoorBash:   A player with this skill has a chance to break down a door\r\n                by the shear force aplied by hurling their body into it.\r\n                This is a tiring skill and can even damage you if not\r\n                careful.  Ever bashed a door down and found that no floor\r\n                was on the other side? (HINT)\r\n
2023-07-25 15:51:55.029275-07	f	SYSTEM	16	FEAR\r\n    This incantation puts fear into the target of the spell.  This will\r\n    result in the instant flight of that target instead of them remaining\r\n    to fight.

2023-07-25 15:51:55.763305-07	f	SYSTEM	183	CALL LIGHTNING\r\n    The cleric that prays for this spell must have the storm at their\r\n    command, without it there is no lightning from which to call the\r\n    prayer.  After the long prayer has been cited the storm releases its\r\n    power upon the unfortunate target allowing it to feel the full power\r\n    of the storm, and the truth of faith.  It has been noted that the\r\n    priests that adhere to complete compliance with the alignment of their\r\n    diety bring forth bolts of extreme power often downing a small army of\r\n    goblins.\r\n\r\n    Duration:   None\r\n    Damage:     Special\r\n    Special:    Normal damage is 2d6, can not be saved against\r\n                1d6 + ( Level/5 )d6 can be saved for half damage.\r\n                A 50th level cleric does 13d6 points of damage.\r\n

Water that\r\n                    normally can be walked through, not water that is too\r\n                    deep and requires a boat to traverse.  This skills is\r\n                    benefitial if you must leave your frigate off of shore\r\n                    due to the shallows.  Yes, frigates are being made for\r\n                    cross ocean journeys.\r\n\r\n    Endurance:      A player proficient with endurance has a good chance\r\n                    of maintaining his/her stamina in a fight.  This skill\r\n                    coincides with a players constitution and what percent\r\n                    of their hits have been left.  All classes will\r\n                    benefit from this skill.\r\n\r\n    Deciphering:    This skill aids those that wish to read the arcane\r\n                    works of magic and have a better chance of\r\n                    understanding the spell that is written.  All classes\r\n                    will benefit from this skill.  Because you are a\r\n                    castor does not mean you have the ability to read\r\n                    other spells besides the ones you know. Essentially\r\n                    this is the fabled 'READ MAGIC' but applies to all\r\n                    classes that wish to use scrolls other then recall.\r\n\r\n    Two_Hand:       All characters may and most likely will wield weapons\r\n                    two-handed in this world.  A mage can apply this to a\r\n                    staff, a cleric to a hammer..  you get the point.\r\n                    Because you wield a weapon two-handed, you may not use\r\n                    a shield nor hold something in your hand, punch will\r\n                    not work while doing this also.  This skill improves\r\n                    the chance that you will maintain your grip on your\r\n                    weapon when a foe tries to disarm you, it will also\r\n                    aid you in damaging your enemy slightly more since you\r\n                    are now applying all of your upper body to the blow.\r\n                    Characters and still be disarmed even with this skill\r\n                    though, no one is 100% proficient.\r\n\r\n    Bare_Hand:      All characters may attack with no weapon at all, doing\r\n                    minor damage plus any additional strength that might\r\n                    apply.

2023-07-25 15:51:55.497252-07	f	SYSTEM	124	EXPERIENCE\r\n    Whenever you kill a monster you earn experience points.  When enough\r\n    experience points are earned, you raise a level after going to a\r\n    teacher and typing "gain".\r\n\r\n    A player will earn exp based on the number of classes they have.  ie.\r\n    amount = amount/number of classes.  This is true for both multi and\r\n    single class characters.  A single class will go up in level faster as\r\n    it may seem on the outside, but a multi will actual have the same\r\n    amount of exp spread between the number of classes.\r\n\r\n    When dying, a player loses exp in accordance to the following chart:\r\n\r\n        Level               Amount\r\n        1-7                 1/( 6 * number of classes)\r\n        7-14                1/( 5 * number of classes)\r\n        15-21               1/( 4 * number of classes)\r\n        22-28               1/( 3 * number of classes)\r\n        29-49               1/( 2 * number of classes)\r\n\r\n    As you can see, low levelers lose less exp then a more experienced\r\n    adventurer.  The key word is experienced, a player that has been\r\n    around long enough to obtain a level 29 or above has built sufficient\r\n    resources to protect themself and provide a means to avoid death.Low\r\n    level players do not have this advantage on their side, this is the\r\n    reason for the smaller reduction in exp loss when dieing.\r\n\r\n    It may seem that multi class characters are losing less exp then a\r\n    single class character, but remember, the multi class character has\r\n    already split the exp amount between the classes.  Since the amount\r\n    initial given was split, and the formulae is above (amount  = amount /\r\n    number of classes) the amount lost should also be used in the same\r\n    fashion to make it fair between multi and single class characters.\r\n    This algorythim has both types of players basically earning exp and\r\n    losing exp at the same rate even though the numbers may not actual be\r\n    the same when compared.\r\n\r\n    SEE ALSO: GROUP\r\n

Look to the\n   northwest of Shylar.\n o The more adventurous newbie may find a wealth of experience in the\n   Lair of the Kobolds, in the southern hills.  However, they may also\n   find the sharp scimitars of the orcs that wander there.\n o The dead of Shylar may profit the living who dare to go into the\n   Shylar Moore cemetary.  Southeast of Pastue's chapel, the moans of\n   the restless dead can be heard.\n o The forest, west of Shylar, has many small animals who can be fought\n   by those who are careful.  Ware the Goblins to the south though!\n\nLevels 4-8:\n o Giant ants have formed a great colony to the northwest, and many poor\n   newbies have failed to return from the depths of their caverns.\n o The maidens of Pain make their home in the Temple of Lovitar, far to\n   the northeast of Shylar.  Beautiful and cold, these ladies do not take\n   kindly to male intruders.\n o Goblins wander the forests to the southwest of Shylar, and they are said\n   to have a small encampment in that area.\n o The tower of Necromancy can yield many mysterious rewards to those who\n   are resourceful enough to penetrate the depths, and heights.  Hidden in\n   the Troll Mountains, north of Shylar, it awaits plundering.\n\nLevels 8-12:\n o An evil encampment of Drow has been rumored to exist somewhere along\n   the northwestern river.  Enter the dark forests and try to find them\n   if you feel like slaughtering the creatures of darkness.\n o The city of Highstaff has denzies, both fair and foul.  An arena offers\n   the intrepid player a chance to pit his or her strength against the\n   gladiators, or even the ferocious beasts of mythology!\n o Unfortunately, a bandit camp has grown to strength in the Redspine\n   Mountains.  The Evil Grugnik attempts to waylay travellers between\n   Highstaff and Shylar.\n o A dwarven kingdom is hidden somewhere in the southern hills.  It has\n   riches and special items of great power, available nowhere else in the\n   known world!\n o The port city of Gredth, whose slavers have captured many a foolish\n   newbie, can offer great rewards to those who travel the dangerous\n   path to get there.\n o The jungles around Nesthar, far to the west, have many strange and\n   exotic beasts which can be wrestled with.\n o A monostary is nestled deep in the south-eastern mountains, betwen the\n   Redspine and the Black ranges.  A brave soul might challenge some of\n   these simple people to unarmed combat, if he dare!\n o Lizards and other strange beasts walk the gnarled woods that lie west\n   of Gredth.  Beware!  There are also powerful slaadi who share this\n   region of the world!\n\nLevels 12+\n o The ruins of Ancient Midgaard can be found in a desolate and isolated\n   valley, far to the south.  It is rumored that a cult has developed there\n   to worship the dark god Aklan.\n o Orc caves dot the redspine, and offer great rewards to those who can\n   find and subdue them.\n o Trolls have made their home in the northern mountains, and stories of\n   a gigantic bird, who can lift entire houses in his talons, also come\n   from this area.\n o The horrible slaadi make their home and temple deep in the gnarled woods.\n o A new underwater species has been found below the cliffs of Highstaff.\n   It is rumored that the thieves and lowlives of the city know the way.\n o The temple of Drenth has gained in power and now is a major force in\n   Eastern Highstaff.  Visitors would be well advised to get permission\n   before entering their shrine.\n o Giants make their home in the western Troll mountains.\n o A nest of Great Lizards can be found in the gnarled woods.\n o The Ogre Havens have expended and threaten Highstaff itself!  Several\n   powerful guildmasters have been captured and are being held prisoner.\n o The Legendary Asgard lives at the top of the world.  A powerful Lich,\n   Asgard is not troubled by many mortals... at least, they don't trouble\n   him for long.\n o Rumors of a great Black Drake, sleeping deep within the jungles of\n   Nesthar, refuse to be quelled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t-Dread Quixadhal, Dark Lord of VI.\n

They don't care about magic\n           and most other races don't care much about them.\nGnomes:    Smaller versions of the dwarves.

Not every god has the same set of\n           values... One god's Good is another god's Evil.\nThief:     The thief is the outcast of society.  Any thief knows that\n           the misfortune of others can be turned to a tidy profit!\n           The true power of the thief is in the accumulation of wealth.\nWarrior:   UNNNGGH!  Me kill things!  As you'd guess, the fighters of\n           this place choose force as the answer to just about\n           everything.  Unfortunately for the rest of us, it often\n           works!\nMage:      The mage believes that brute force is as useless as grubbing\n           on your knees before some god.  TRUE power comes from\n           knowledge of the universe!  Many a mage has died to prove\n           that point.  But, a few have lived...\nRanger:    The ranger chooses to take a little bit from all the classes.\n           An outdoorsman, he is self-sufficient and has learned to\n           fight very well.  His closeness to nature has taught him some\n           skills in magic and given him some understanding of the ways\n           of the nature gods.  Society has taught him trickery as well!\n\nClass [CTWMR?]:

He was just\nyour typical DikuMUD, and a few people got together to play around with\nsome code.  They hacked the code for some length of time, occasionally\nscreaming obscenities, or saying things like, \\"Huh, huh, huh... This\nbubble sort is COOL!\\"  Eventually, they opened it to the mud-starved\npeople of WMU and called it Wiley II.  A poor little Sun 3/60 was found\nand managed to keep 30 to 40 people amused with its antics for almost\ntwo years.  At this point, Cyric the Destroyer took the game down for\nrenovations.  There was much anticipation of Wiley III's return, and it\nseemed like we would soon be in for a new experience in mudding!  Alas,\nit was not to be.  For Cyric had lost interest in the project and took\nhis Source with him.  The half-finished Wiley III was released to the\ninternet via anonymous FTP for a half-hearted month before being buried\nforever.\n\n    But wait!  An old packrat hacker who went by the subtle name Dread\nQuixadhal, Lord of VI, had snagged a copy and left it buried on his hard\ndrive for several years.  After playing with several broken LpMUDs and\neven a different DikuMUD, he dragged the Wiley III source out and forced\nit to learn to like Linux.\n\n    You have here the result of nearly 4 years of ad-hoc development!\n      PLEASE read the wizlist to find out more about these jokers!\n      Cyric, Harlequin, Muth, Grimwell, Derkhil, Elcid and Muidnar.\n      Dread Quixadhal, Muidnar, Dirk, Malistrum, Zar, Highlander,\n      and Sedna.\n

A sense of sudden panic nearly overwhelms you at the thought that\nyou may never get to journey through the dark lands of DeadMUD again.  The\nwind seems to chill you a bit more as it begins blowing leaves around your\nfeet.  A snapping of twigs hearlds the approaching storm, and a few enormous\nbolts of lightning seem to sound like nails being driven into a heavy wooden\nbox.  The sun is setting, and a few flakes of slow hit your face through the\ngusts.  Suddenly, you hear hoofbeats, and a gigantic rider appears before you!\n\n    "I have come for you.  Are you prepared?", she asks in a deep resonate\nvoice.  Before you can even begin to reply she draws a gigantic bastard sword.\nThe dim reddish light of the evening sun seems to avoid the ebony black blade.\nShe adds quietly, "I wish this could be painless for you, but it won't be."\n\n    You see her slowly draw back your doom, a slight twitch of her shoulder\nand you hear the whistle of approaching freedom.  A gentle tap, and an odd\nsliding sensation, and you realize the whistling is now air rushing past your\nears.                        A confused jumble of spinning images...\n            Blood...\n                                Darkness...\n                                                        Eternal.\n
