<>--info nomad
Name: Nomad background
Command: nomad
Creators: Anipa, Digga, Argon and franco
Maximum level: 15

Description:
You have spent your entire life travelling the world with your parents and
it shows in everything you do.  The nomad way of life has become yours and
you wouldn't have it any other way.  Everything you know you have learned
from your parents as your family wandered the surrounding areas.  Your
skills are somewhat limited to the knowledge of your parents and their
ability to train you in what you need to know to survive in the nomad way
of life.  Your first 15 levels symbolize these days of teaching by your parents
so you can better learn what guild(s) you want to join.

When you were young you were taught the differences between evil and good.
Your parents told you lots of stories about the gods that are living in
heaven, sometimes fighting against each other, but enjoying peaceful
time periods as well. You learned how to pray to your God to get blessings
for your everyday work and to cure the wounds you had gotten when playing
with your friends. But most importantly you learned that your life has a
great purpose, to spread the word of your God.

Description:
The civilized background indicates that your parents are from a civilized
culture.  Unlike the barbaric Nomads, or the cloistered Religous folk, you
have been raised with refinement.  You understand commerce and trade, as
has been passed on from your parents and their parents before them. You
prefer a town to a wilderness, and aren't afraid to take what you need, if
you choose.  The skills and spells you learn during your first 15 levels 
symbolize the things your parents have taught you: useful tools for 
survival and the tools of commerce and trade. You can't choose what you
are taught, but those skills and spells will be yours throughout your 
adventurous life and the basis of all you learn in the future.

<>--info duck
Vorth <bat>: woo woo to yoo too. :P
Swift [chat]: where are you ?
The Duck race
General description:
  Ducks are humanoids that vaguely resemble humans in their appearance,
  but their build is lighter, their face is shaped oddly, they have
  beaks and feathers. It has been said that they are the final stage of
  evolution in the birds. But this is said mostly by those who think
  that humanoid shape equals intelligence. On the ecology of ducks is
  said that they prefer to live near rivers and lakes. They like
  swimming, and quite many of them feel adventurous. And many of the
  less adventurous ducks earn their living as an acrobat or a clown.

Stats:
Strength: low                      Dexterity: below average
Intelligence: excellent            Wisdom: good
Constitution: below average        Size: average

<>--
Other features:
They regenerate magic points very fast. They are superior to humans and
therefore need more experience points. Even the most difficult arcane powers
can be mastered by them. They can fly above water. They are sensitive to their
surroundings. They are too small to use two handed weapons. They have a faster
than normal heart beat.

Vorth <bat>: btw: hiya Rad :)
<>--info ent
The Ent race
General description:
  Ents are also known as the treemen. No one is sure if they are
  ancestors of the trees or if they have evolved from the trees or if
  they are totally separate. The saying 'slow as an ent' has only
  little basis in the nature. The basis that exists is more on the
  thinking process of the ents. They consider everything at least a few
  times but when aroused an ent can act fast enough to destroy whole
  castles in less than one night. The life of an adventuring ent is full
  of odd and unique dangers. It haven't been few times when the
  strongest ent of the party has died at a young and almost
  nondangerous little firelizard because the ent was set afire. Ents
  tend to be mages or more often druids or priests but their slow
  thinking process makes them more scholars than dangerous wielders of
  arcane powers.

<>--
Stats:
Strength: above average            Dexterity: extremely poor
Intelligence: below average        Wisdom: superb
Constitution: average              Size: large

Other features:
They have a thick skin. They have good natural weapons. They regenerate magic
points very fast. They are superior to humans and therefore need more
experience points. Arcane powers are easy for them to master. They adapt well
to the most complicated skills. Even the most difficult arcane powers can be
mastered by them. They heal faster when in water. They regenerate only in lit
places. They can suck nutrition out of the ground. They can use two handed
weapons with one hand.

They know the following spell automatically:
 Light                          30%

<>--info thrikhren
The Thrikhren race
General description:
  Thrikhrens are a race of very intelligent largish insectoids. They
  are often referred as Mantis' warriors but this is a mistake.
  Thrikrens are mostly equal to humans in strenght and endurance, their
  major area of specialty is the mind, both mental control and
  discipline of magic. Some of the most proficient mages and psions are
  thrikhrens. But this doesn't mean that a thrikhren is in need of help
  in physical combat, their chitinious shells and sharp claws allow them
  decent fighting capabilities. In adventuring life thrikhrens are
  valued and accepted members of many parties, it's not even uncommon
  that they are at high position in the party.

General description:

<>--info satyr
The Satyr race
General description:
  Satyrs are small creatures that resemble a crossbreed of a goat and a
  smallish humanoid. They have the hindlegs of a goat and the upper
  torso of a small human. Merry, singing, dextrous, always having fun
  time. This is what most of the other races think about satyrs and this
  is quite much true and since almost all satyrs show an aptitude on
  music they tend to become wandering bards or minstrels. All satyrs
  are supposed to be able to use at least minor spells but not all of
  them pick up the trade of magic and if they do they don't usually turn
  out as mages but more as bards. The common lot for a satyr in a party
  of adventurers is to use their magic to help others in battle and
  after the battle to sing about it. In an adventuring party a satyr has
  an unending ability to end up with more than his or her lot of the
  loot but no one cares about it because a satyr always has a good story
  or two to be told to the inquirer.

General description:
  Sprites are small creatures from the fairy world who have moved to the
  World of Batmud. There they make their living as scouts, messengers
  and even spies. Their small size and weak physical appearance hides
  great talent in magic and ever astonishing dextrous abilities. The
  flying ability of sprites has been only rumored of and this far the
  sightings of a flying sprite have been ended with a dispell magic
  spell. This suggests that the wings of the sprites, and their cousins
  cokes, aren't meant for flying.

  ever managed to find out if the clothy wrapping that surrouds the
  zombi is their skin or some sort of protective dress and there is no
  knowledge about the internal biologics of a zombie. The zombi are
  most often the mightiest wielders of arcane powers and it is said that
  they can use spells no other mortal is able to access. To cause more

<>--info minotaur
The Minotaur race
General description:
  Minotaurs are a race of bullheaded, ogresized humanoids both strong
  and durable. Their origins are clouded in mystery. Some scholars claim
  that minotaurs were ogrish shamans that revered highly the bull god
  and were given the shape of minotaur as a gift. Whatever the cause
  they are all worshippers of the bull god and quite a power to reckon
  in physical battle. The horns of a minotaur are not just a decoration
  but an effective weapon that comes with the package. Most minotaurs
  are quite skilled in the art of physical warfare but they don't trust
  magic or practitioners thereof.

Strength: good                     Dexterity: average
Intelligence: poor                 Wisdom: poor
Constitution: above average        Size: large
<>--

Other features:
They have a thick skin. They have good natural weapons. They regenerate damage
very fast. They regenerate magic points very fast. They are superior to humans
and therefore need more experience points. They are quick learners of skills.
They adapt well to the most complicated skills. They are sensitive to their
surroundings.

<>--info ogre
Ghost of Goldy [ghost]: ress..
The Ogre race
General description:
  Ogres are a race of large-sized, strong humanoids. They are quite
  capable of facing natural hazards and wounds. They are not very bright
  though. The closest ogres get to genius is when they cook a genius of
  an another race. This happens very rarely though because the
  stupidness of ogres lets a succesful genius to fool his way out of
  their stewing pot. All ogres aren't that evil though. And most of the
  more adventurous ogres tend to care for their smaller friends. And
  there are many succesful adventuring bands that have enlisted a
  friendly and helpful ogre as their battering ram.

Stats:
Strength: very good                Dexterity: below average
Intelligence: low                  Wisdom: low
Constitution: above average        Size: large

<>--info orc
The Orc race
General description:
  Orc is a race of small, usually green-skinned humanoids with misshapen
  bodies, elongated arms and twisted legs. They have a short lifespan
  and aren't bright. Their main reason to live is to collect earthly
  possessions. It is thought that orcs are warped elves but no one is
  sure who did warp them and why. There are rumors of few orcs who have
  picked up the unusual career of adventuring but to date these rumors
  have not been verified. If the adventuring orc exists he has to
  overcome both his physical hindrances and the prejudices of the World.

Stats:
Strength: above average            Dexterity: above average
Intelligence: poor                 Wisdom: low
Constitution: above average        Size: average

con and str in lit outdoor locations. They can eat corpses.

The Tinmen race
General description:
The tinmen are said to be creations of powerfull magicians.

<>--info wolfman
The Wolfman race
General description:
  Wolfman is a race of humanoids that have the head and paws of wolf.
  They are still partly human in appearance and this is said to suggest
  their origin as either cursed humans or a result of the magical
  experiments of some mad mage.  Wolfmen have been subjected to many
  prejudicies. Their state has been said to be a punishment for their
  sins unspeakable, but this statement has been dropped after the great
  elf/orc war during which the wolfmen aided elves by tracking down and
  terminating many orcish raiding parties. After the war wolfmen have
  been generally accepted in adventuring parties even though they aren't
  trusted with the leadership of parties.

<>--info cromagnon
Poet [bat]: vorth any particular reason my happyfunball never hits anyone?
The Cromagnon race
General description:
  Cromagnons are a living relic from the early dawn of human history.
  They are living ancestors of humans and they are thought as humans by
  most. Cromagnons have some advantages over the humans though. Their
  harder life has given them more physical power and better grasp of the
  basic skills but they lack the arts of magic completely because of
  their underdeveloped brains. Mostly it is safe to presume that a
  cromagnon behaves like a human would. Adventuring cromagnons are
  usually those who do the hard work in the party, they do so on choice
  not because they are forced to it.

Stats:
Strength: good                     Dexterity: above average
Intelligence: poor                 Wisdom: poor
Constitution: above average        Size: average
<>--

Other features:
They regenerate damage very fast. They are superior to humans and therefore
need more experience points. They are quick learners of skills. They adapt
well to the most complicated skills.

<>--info cyclops
The Cyclops race
General description:
  Cyclops are quite similar to their cousins giants and they are thought
  to be a mutated subrace of the giant, but there is no difficulty to
  notice the subtle difference between a giant and a cyclops because
  cyclops are much more awkward and clumsier than giants. The single eye
  of a cyclops doesn't render it helpless though. A cyclops warrior is
  one of the most formidable forces in a melee battle. The cyclops
  usually work as mercenaries like the giants. Their neverending desire
  to eat lambs sometimes gets them to trouble with local farmers.

Stats:
Strength: superb                   Dexterity: average
Intelligence: very poor            Wisdom: very poor
Constitution: good                 Size: large

The Giant race
General description:
  Giant is  a race of huge and strong but stupid humanoids. Their
  strenght is unparalled in this world. They share the title of
  strongest known creatures with the oldest and largest of dragons.
  Giants are known for their optidy in opening new doors. Giants aren't
  common in adventuring bands because they don't usually mix well with
  their smaller companions. Often a party will hire a mercenary giant
  though. Especially when planning to face odds that favor their
  opponents. There are few occasions of a regular giant in a party but
  these giants have either received their rank as member by hard work or
  great sacrifices.

Stats:
Strength: superb                   Dexterity: low
Intelligence: very poor            Wisdom: very poor

<>--info troll
The Troll race
General description:
  Trolls are a race of larger-than-human humanoids but not as large or
  powerful as ogres. The metabolism of a troll is faster than that of
  any other creature, mythical or not. The killing of a troll is said to
  be almost impossible, if they are going to be killed by physical damage.
  The trolls' hasted metabolism allows them to regenerate lost body
  parts in a matter of days and the damage they take is often regenerated
  during battle. Thanks to their large size, physical strength, endurance
  and the gift of regeneration most trolls make excellent warriors.
  Also as they aren't as stupid as the giants they are generally accepted
  in adventuring parties.

Stats:
Strength: good                     Dexterity: below average
Intelligence: poor                 Wisdom: low

are allergic to water. They can see in the dark. They have half dex, con and

The Valar race
General description:
  The Valar are the direct children of the Creator, Eru. It is there place in
 the Universe to sing the song of creation.  This makes them very powerful
 beings indeed yet this also makes it difficult for them to change. Their
 numbers are in some ways limited but there are the lesser Maiar that also
 play a small part in the song.
