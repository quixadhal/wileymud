the demonic God, Draen-Dalar pervades the room, forcing his slavelike
followers to worship him with unspeakable rites.

                        Secret Societies

Secret societies are guilds that players can establish.  To establish
a secret society you should go to the secret society creation office
near the adventurers guild.

Secret societies can give players spell, skill and stat bonuses.  They
can consist of as many levels the creator wants them to have.  The
creator can give other players the rights to invite and advance other
players in the society.  The creator can also leave the society, sort
of giving it away to the other players he has given rights to control
the society.

Once you create a society you will be told how to configure and
control the society.

The Ent race
General description:
  Ents are also known as the treemen. No one is sure if they are
  ancestors of the trees or if they have evolved from the trees or if
  they are totally separate. The saying 'slow as an ent' has only
  little basis in the nature. The basis that exists is more on the
  thinking process of the ents. They consider everything at least a few
  times but when aroused an ent can act fast enough to destroy whole
  castles in less than one night. The life of an adventuring ent is full
  of odd and unique dangers. It haven't been few times when the
  strongest ent of the party has died at a young and almost
  nondangerous little firelizard because the ent was set afire. Ents
  tend to be mages or more often druids or priests but their slow
  thinking process makes them more scholars than dangerous wielders of
  arcane powers.

                                GRIDWARS

  The objective of gridwars is to kill as many as possible opposite coloured
bugs by spitting at them. Players start with 100hp and 100acid. From one
kill you gain 10hp and 1 point, from dying you lose 1 point, from quitting
you lose 1 point. Your points will remain until the game ends. If you kill
same coloured bug you gain no points.

  The area is square, x*y which can be defined by a wizard. Between the rooms
there are walls which can be destroyed by spitting at them. Some new walls
may appear every now and then during the game. 

  During the game you can see other bugs' coordinates. Every color has its
own pile of shit, which regenerates your acid when you stand next to it. 
While in the game, typing score shows the coordinates of your pile. If the
pile gets hit by a spit, it is teleported into a random location in the grid.

  The command to spit is spit. Usage of it is 'spit <power> <direction>',
where power ranges from 1 to 100 (limited by your amount of acid), and 
direction is e,n,w or s. The range of one spit is 10. The more power you 
use in a spit, the more damage it causes if it hits a bug. If it hits a wall,
it is destroyed. 
        For every action there is an equal and opposite government
Program.
