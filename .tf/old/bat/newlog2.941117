You have new news in groups inform, general, flame, test, race, leader and
 guilds.
You may now either enter the game as an visitor or if you feel like
creating a real character you can create one. You should use a visitor
character until you know what kind of a character you wish to play.
The best way to learn about BatMUD is to ask other players. The 'help'
command is rather useful too, try 'help' and 'help topics'.
Obvious exits are: church and creation.
Shrapnel the Visitor
Twatpants the Visitor
Aaron the Visitor
Type: 'church' to enter the city church as a visitor
Shrapnel leaves creation.
<>--creation
In here you can select the kind of background your character has.
This affects your characters skills and spells in the beginning.
Later on it affects the ways you can join guilds.  There are four
backgrounds to choose from, and they are:
  nomad, magical, religious and civilized
To get information about a certain background you should type:
  info <background>
Once you have decided what you want to be you should type:
  select <background>
There are no obvious exits.

Aaron arrives.
Lacramobo shouts: Rent times now user-definable!
<>--select civilized
You choose civilized to be your background.  You automatically learn
some skills and spells.  For more information type 'civilized help'.
To see what skills and spells you have you should use the 'show'
command.
Now you can select a race.  This affects most of your abilities.  You
should pick your race carefully.  You can change your race during game
play, but changing the race has its drawbacks.  Only the races suitable
for your background are listed.  There are also some races that are not
available to all players.

<>--info sprite
The Sprite race
General description:
  Sprites are small creatures from the fairy world who have moved to the
  World of Batmud. There they make their living as scouts, messengers
  and even spies. Their small size and weak physical appearance hides
  great talent in magic and ever astonishing dextrous abilities. The
  flying ability of sprites has been only rumored of and this far the
  sightings of a flying sprite have been ended with a dispell magic
  spell. This suggests that the wings of the sprites, and their cousins
  cokes, aren't meant for flying.

Stats:
Strength: poor                     Dexterity: superb
Intelligence: average              Wisdom: average
Constitution: poor                 Size: small

<>--
Other features:
They regenerate magic points very fast. They are superior to humans and
therefore need more experience points. Arcane powers are easy for them to
master. They adapt well to the most complicated skills. Even the most
difficult arcane powers can be mastered by them. They can fly above water.
They can see in the dark. They are too small to use two handed weapons. They
can detect magic on things. They can see invisible things. They have a faster
than normal heart beat. They glow in the dark.

<>--info hobbit
The Hobbit race
General description:
  Hobbit is a race of small humanoid creatures, quite similar to the
  human child in appearance. They are quite resistant to poisons, very
  agile and quite fast. Their nimbleness has given their race a reputation
  of being a race of thieves. This view is quite widespread despite the
  fact that most hobbits are honorable peasants and labourers. Hobbits
  love simple joys and generally shun adventuring and the troubles it
  causes.  Every now and then one or two of them step down on the road
  of adventure and prove again their races natural adeptness in the hard
  life.

Stats:
Strength: below average            Dexterity: excellent
Intelligence: above average        Wisdom: average
Constitution: average              Size: small
<>--

Other features:
They regenerate damage fast. They regenerate magic points very fast. They
adapt well to the most complicated skills. They can see in the dark.

They know the following spell automatically:
 Create food                    40%

You are now done with the creation of a new character. Once you
continue your journey you can't come back to here with this
character. Once are certain you wish to continue to your guild room
from here, you should type 'continue'.
During your first levels you can't train skills or spells, they are
automatically given to you according to your background.
If you wish to redo something you should quit now.
You should probably type 'help survival guide' as soon as possible. It
is very long, but well worth the trouble reading.
