As grey traces of dawn tinge the eastern sky
The three travellers, men of Willowdale
Emerge from the forest shadow
Fording the river Dun, they turn south
Journeying into the dark and forbidding lands of The Necromancer
Even now, the intensity of his dread power can be felt
Weakening the body and saddening the heart
Ultimatly, they will become empty mindless spectres
Stripped of will and soul
Only their thirst for freedom gives them hunger for vengence.
Silence shrouds the forest
As the birds announce the dawn
Three travellers ford the river
And southward journey on
The road is lines with peril
The air is charged with fear
The shadow of his nearness
Weighs like iron tears.
Shreds of black cloud move in overcast skies
The Necromancer keeps watch with magic prism eyes
He views all his lands and is already aware
Of the three helpless invaders trapped in his lair.
Brooding in the tower
Watching o'er his lands
Holding up a creature
Helplessly they stand
Gaze into his prisms
Knowing pioneer
Leads them to the dungeons
Smothers them with fear
They bow defeated.
Enter the Champion, Prince Pieter appears
To battle for freedom from chains of long years
The spell has been broken, the dark lands are bright
The wraith of the Necromancer soars away in the night.
Stealthily attacking
By trust he slays his foe
The men are freed
Run now in labyrinths below
The wraith of the Necromancer
Shadows through the sky
Another land to darken
With evil prism eyes!
