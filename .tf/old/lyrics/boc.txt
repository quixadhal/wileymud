Lecherous, invisible, beware the limping cat!
Whose black teeth grip between loose jaws, still ripe and fully bloomed
A rose that's not from anywhere that you would know or I would care.
And the owners act most cheerfully back home at Conray's Bar
When their patrons' thoughts at last grow too big for their skulls
Awful things are happening, we've let this drama fold
And now the time has come at last to crush the motif of the rose.
