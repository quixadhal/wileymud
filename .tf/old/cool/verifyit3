I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

HUMANs are the most "neutral" of all races.  They have normal attribute
levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:
        * Other races view HUMANs neutrally and normally do not attack.
        * Are equally good in all classes.
        * Their stature does not make them an easy target to hit.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

HUMANs are the most "neutral" of all races.  They have normal attribute
levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:
        * Other races view HUMANs neutrally and normally do not attack.
        * Are equally good in all classes.
        * Their stature does not make them an easy target to hit.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.
