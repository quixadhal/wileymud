HUMANs are the most "neutral" of all races.  They have normal attribute
levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:
        * Other races view HUMANs neutrally and normally do not attack.
        * Are equally good in all classes.
        * Their stature does not make them an easy target to hit.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

HUMANs are the most "neutral" of all races.  They have normal attribute
levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:
        * Other races view HUMANs neutrally and normally do not attack.
        * Are equally good in all classes.
        * Their stature does not make them an easy target to hit.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

HUMANs are the most "neutral" of all races.  They have normal attribute
levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:
        * Other races view HUMANs neutrally and normally do not attack.
        * Are equally good in all classes.
        * Their stature does not make them an easy target to hit.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

HUMANs are the most "neutral" of all races.  They have normal attribute
levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:
        * Other races view HUMANs neutrally and normally do not attack.
        * Are equally good in all classes.
        * Their stature does not make them an easy target to hit.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

HUMANs are the most "neutral" of all races.  They have normal attribute
levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:
        * Other races view HUMANs neutrally and normally do not attack.
        * Are equally good in all classes.
        * Their stature does not make them an easy target to hit.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

HUMANs are the most "neutral" of all races.  They have normal attribute
levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:
        * Other races view HUMANs neutrally and normally do not attack.
        * Are equally good in all classes.
        * Their stature does not make them an easy target to hit.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.

HUMANs are the most "neutral" of all races.  They have normal attribute
levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:
        * Other races view HUMANs neutrally and normally do not attack.
        * Are equally good in all classes.
        * Their stature does not make them an easy target to hit.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.

The MAGE class is a 'spellcasting' class devoted primarily toward control
over the elements.  The universe contains an unmeasured power the MAGE taps
into to influence the world.  MAGE spells are devoted to the invoking,
hermetic, and combative nature.  MAGEs fare a little better than their
CLERIC counterparts in hand-to-hand combat though they much prefer to
stand back and roast their enemies with a FIREBALL.

HUMANs are the most "neutral" of all races.  They have normal attribute
levels yet are the most versatile in all the available professions.
Their strengths are:
        * Other races view HUMANs neutrally and normally do not attack.
        * Are equally good in all classes.
        * Their stature does not make them an easy target to hit.

The PSIONICIST class is a 'spellcasting' class similar to Mages and Clerics,
but with several important differences.  Where a Mage's power comes from
harnessing external energies present in all matter, and a Cleric's comes from
his or her deity, the Psionicist derives all of his or her power from within.
The Psionicist harnesses, shapes, and utilizes the natural forces which infuse
his or her own being.  As a result, many of the devotions that a Psionicist can
practice are strictly personal in effect, and cannot be used on other players.

Disclaimer:  Psionicist class was originally developed by Thelonius (EnvyMud)
from 'The Complete Psionics Handbook' by Steve Winter, published by TSR, Inc.  
Skills and spells described therein will be quite similar to those here, though
the interpretation has been changed to coincide with a MERC DIKU MUD.  
Questions, comments, and suggestions are welcome.
