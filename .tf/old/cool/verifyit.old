I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.

I modified the source to look for .tfrc in ~/.tf/tfrc so there are fewer files 
cluttering up your home directory.  Just "cd ~;mkdir .tf;mv .tfrc .tf/tfrc".  
Also, if you want the whole slew of extension commands, just "/require 
everything.tf" and it will be loaded as older versions did.
